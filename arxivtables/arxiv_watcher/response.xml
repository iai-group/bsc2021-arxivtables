    <title>Causal Inference Under Unmeasured Confounding With Negative Controls: A
  Minimax Learning Approach</title>
    <summary>  We study the estimation of causal parameters when not all confounders are
observed and instead negative controls are available. Recent work has shown how
these can enable identification and efficient estimation via two so-called
bridge functions. In this paper, we tackle the primary challenge to causal
inference using negative controls: the identification and estimation of these
bridge functions. Previous work has relied on uniqueness and completeness
assumptions on these functions that may be implausible in practice and also
focused on their parametric estimation. Instead, we provide a new
identification strategy that avoids both uniqueness and completeness. And, we
provide a new estimators for these functions based on minimax learning
formulations. These estimators accommodate general function classes such as
reproducing Hilbert spaces and neural networks. We study finite-sample
convergence results both for estimating bridge function themselves and for the
final estimation of the causal parameter. We do this under a variety of
combinations of assumptions that include realizability and closedness
conditions on the hypothesis and critic classes employed in the minimax
estimator. Depending on how much we are willing to assume, we obtain different
convergence rates. In some cases, we show the estimate for the causal parameter
may converge even when our bridge function estimators do not converge to any
valid bridge function. And, in other cases, we show we can obtain
semiparametric efficiency.

    <title>USB: Universal-Scale Object Detection Benchmark</title>
    <summary>  Benchmarks, such as COCO, play a crucial role in object detection. However,
existing benchmarks are insufficient in scale variation, and their protocols
are inadequate for fair comparison. In this paper, we introduce the
Universal-Scale object detection Benchmark (USB). USB has variations in object
scales and image domains by incorporating COCO with the recently proposed Waymo
Open Dataset and Manga109-s dataset. To enable fair comparison, we propose USB
protocols by defining multiple thresholds for training epochs and evaluation
image resolutions. By analyzing methods on the proposed benchmark, we designed
fast and accurate object detectors called UniverseNets, which surpassed all
baselines on USB and achieved state-of-the-art results on existing benchmarks.
Specifically, UniverseNets achieved 54.1% AP on COCO test-dev with 20 epochs
training, the top result among single-stage detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset
Challenge 2020 2D detection, and the first place in the NightOwls Detection
Challenge 2020 all objects track. The code is available at
https://github.com/shinya7y/UniverseNet .

    <title>The ThreeDWorld Transport Challenge: A Visually Guided Task-and-Motion
  Planning Benchmark for Physically Realistic Embodied AI</title>
    <summary>  We introduce a visually-guided and physics-driven task-and-motion planning
benchmark, which we call the ThreeDWorld Transport Challenge. In this
challenge, an embodied agent equipped with two 9-DOF articulated arms is
spawned randomly in a simulated physical home environment. The agent is
required to find a small set of objects scattered around the house, pick them
up, and transport them to a desired final location. We also position containers
around the house that can be used as tools to assist with transporting objects
efficiently. To complete the task, an embodied agent must plan a sequence of
actions to change the state of a large number of objects in the face of
realistic physical constraints. We build this benchmark challenge using the
ThreeDWorld simulation: a virtual 3D environment where all objects respond to
physics, and where can be controlled using fully physics-driven navigation and
interaction API. We evaluate several existing agents on this benchmark.
Experimental results suggest that: 1) a pure RL model struggles on this
challenge; 2) hierarchical planning-based agents can transport some objects but
still far from solving this task. We anticipate that this benchmark will
empower researchers to develop more intelligent physics-driven robots for the
physical world.

    <title>AgentFormer: Agent-Aware Transformers for Socio-Temporal Multi-Agent
  Forecasting</title>
    <summary>  Predicting accurate future trajectories of multiple agents is essential for
autonomous systems, but is challenging due to the complex agent interaction and
the uncertainty in each agent's future behavior. Forecasting multi-agent
trajectories requires modeling two key dimensions: (1) time dimension, where we
model the influence of past agent states over future states; (2) social
dimension, where we model how the state of each agent affects others. Most
prior methods model these two dimensions separately; e.g., first using a
temporal model to summarize features over time for each agent independently and
then modeling the interaction of the summarized features with a social model.
This approach is suboptimal since independent feature encoding over either the
time or social dimension can result in a loss of information. Instead, we would
prefer a method that allows an agent's state at one time to directly affect
another agent's state at a future time. To this end, we propose a new
Transformer, AgentFormer, that jointly models the time and social dimensions.
The model leverages a sequence representation of multi-agent trajectories by
flattening trajectory features across time and agents. Since standard attention
operations disregard the agent identity of each element in the sequence,
AgentFormer uses a novel agent-aware attention mechanism that preserves agent
identities by attending to elements of the same agent differently than elements
of other agents. Based on AgentFormer, we propose a stochastic multi-agent
trajectory prediction model that can attend to features of any agent at any
previous timestep when inferring an agent's future position. The latent intent
of all agents is also jointly modeled, allowing the stochasticity in one
agent's behavior to affect other agents. Our method significantly improves the
state of the art on well-established pedestrian and autonomous driving
datasets.

    <title>Linear anisotropies in dispersion-measure-based cosmological observables</title>
    <summary>  We derive all contributions to the dispersion measure (DM) of electromagnetic
pulses to linear order in cosmological perturbations, including both density
fluctuations and relativistic effects. We then use this result to calculate the
power spectrum of DM-based cosmological observables to linear order in
perturbations. In particular, we study two cases: maps of the dispersion
measure from a set of localized sources (including the effects of source
clustering), and fluctuations in the density of DM-selected sources. The impact
of most relativistic effects is limited to large angular scales, and is
negligible for all practical applications in the context of ongoing and
envisaged observational programs targeting fast radio bursts. We compare the
leading contributions to DM-space clustering, including the effects of
gravitational lensing, and find that the signal is dominated by the
fluctuations in the free electron column density, rather than the local source
clustering or lensing contributions. To compensate for the disappointing
irrelevance of relativistic effects, we re-derive them in terms of the geodesic
equation for massive particles in a perturbed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
metric.

    <title>How does the chromatic number of a random graph vary?</title>
    <summary>  How does the chromatic number of a graph chosen uniformly at random from all
graphs on $n$ vertices behave? This quantity is a random variable, so one can
ask (i) for bounds on its typical values, and (ii) for bounds on how much it
varies: what is the width (e.g., standard deviation) of its distribution?
  On (i) there has been considerable progress over the last 45 years; on (ii),
which is our focus here, remarkably little. One would like both upper and lower
bounds on the width of the distribution, and ideally a description of the
(appropriately scaled) limiting distribution. There is a well known upper bound
of Shamir and Spencer of order $\sqrt{n}$, improved slightly by Alon to
$\sqrt{n}/\log n$. In the other direction, the first non-trivial bound was
proved by the first author in 2019, showing that the width is at least
$n^{1/4-o(1)}$ for some values of $n$, answering a longstanding question of
Bollob\'as.
  In this paper we have two main aims: first, we shall prove a much stronger
lower bound on the width. We shall show unconditionally that, for some values
of $n$, the width is at least $n^{1/2-o(1)}$, matching the upper bounds up to
the error term. Moreover, conditional on a recently announced sharper estimate
for the chromatic number, we improve the lower bound to order $\sqrt{n} \log
\log n /\log^{3.5} n$, within a logarithmic factor of the upper bound.
  Secondly, we will describe a number of conjectures as to what the true
behaviour of the variation in the chromatic number is, and why. The first form
of this conjecture arises from recent work of Bollob\'as, Heckel, Morris,
Panagiotou, Riordan and Smith. We will also give much more detailed
conjectures, suggesting that the true width, for the worst case $n$, is of
order $\sqrt{n}\log\log n/\log^3 n$, only a factor $\sqrt{\log n}$ larger than
our lower bound. These conjectures also predict a Gaussian limiting
distribution.

    <title>De Finetti-Style Results for Wishart Matrices: Combinatorial Structure
  and Phase Transitions</title>
    <summary>  A recent line of work has studied the relationship between the Wishart matrix
$X^\top X$, where $X\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times n}$ has i.i.d. standard Gaussian
entries, and the corresponding Gaussian matrix with independent entries above
the diagonal. Jiang and Li (2015) and Bubeck et al. (2016) showed that these
two matrix ensembles converge in total variation whenever $d/n^3\to \infty$,
and Bubeck et al. (2016) showed this to be sharp. In this paper we aim to
identify the precise threshold for $d$ in terms of $n$ for subsets of Wishart
matrices to converge in total variation to independent Gaussians. It turns out
that the combinatorial structure of the revealed entries, viewed as the
adjacency matrix of a graph $G$, characterizes the distance from fully
independent. Specifically, we show that the threshold for $d$ depends on the
number of various small subgraphs in $G$. So, even when the number of revealed
entries is fixed, the threshold can vary wildly depending on their
configuration. Convergence of masked Wishart to independent Gaussians thus
inherently involves an interplay between both probabilistic and combinatorial
phenomena. Our results determine the sharp threshold for a large family of $G$,
including Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi $G\sim \mathcal{G}(n,p)$ at all values $p\gtrsim
n^{-2}\mathrm{polylog}(n)$. Our proof techniques are both combinatorial and
information theoretic, which together allow us to carefully unravel the
dependencies in the masked Wishart ensemble.

    <title>Cosmology of complex scalar dark matter: interplay of self-scattering
  and annihilation</title>
    <summary>  The cosmology of a standard model (SM) gauge singlet complex scalar dark
matter (DM), stabilized by a reflection symmetry, is studied including all
renormalizable interactions that preserve the reflection symmetry but can break
the larger global U(1) symmetry of DM number. We find an interesting interplay
of the ensuing DM self-scatterings and annihilations in generating the present
DM density, and possible particle-antiparticle asymmetry in the DM sector. The
role of DM self-scatterings in determining its present density and composition
is a novel phenomenon. The simultaneous presence of the self-scatterings and
annihilations is required to obtain a non-zero asymmetry, which otherwise
vanishes due to unitarity sum rules.

    <title>On sign changes of primitive Fourier coefficients of Siegel cusp forms</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we establish quantitative results for sign changes in certain
subsequences of primitive Fourier coefficients of a non-zero Siegel cusp form
of arbitrary degree over congruence subgroups. As a corollary of our result in
degree two case, we get sign changes of diagonal Fourier coefficients. In the
course of our proofs, we also prove results about the non-vanishing of certain
type of Fourier-Jacobi coefficients of a Siegel cusp form and all theta
components of a Jacobi cusp form of arbitrary degree over congruence subgroups,
which may be of independent interest.

    <title>Rotating Boson Stars Using Finite Differences and Global Newton Methods</title>
    <summary>  We study Rotating Boson Star initial data for Numerical Relativity as
previously considered by Yoshida and Eriguchi, Lai (arXiv:gr-qc/0410040v2), and
Grandclement, Som\'e and Gourgoulhon (arXiv:1405.4837v3). We use a 3 + 1
decomposition as presented by Gourgoulhon (arXiv:1003.5015v2) and Alcubierre,
adapted to an axisymmetric quasi-isotropic spacetime with added regularization
at the axis following work by Ru\'iz, Alcubierre and N\'u\~nez
(arXiv:0706.0923v2) and Torres. The Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations result in a
system of six-coupled, elliptic, nonlinear equations with an added unknown for
the scalar field's frequency $\omega$. Utilizing a Cartesian two-dimensional
grid, finite differences, Global Newton Methods adapted from Deuflhard, the
sparse direct linear solver PARDISO, and properly constraining all variables
generates data sets for rotation azimuthal integers $l \in [0, 6]$. Our
numerical implementation, published in GitHub, is shown to correctly converge
both with respect to the resolution size and boundary extension (fourth-order
and third-order, respectively). Thus, global parameters such as the Komar
masses and angular momenta can be precisely calculated to characterize these
spacetimes. Furthermore, analyzing the full family at fixed rotation integer
produces maximum masses and minimum frequencies. These coincide with previous
results in literature for $l \in [0,2]$ and are new for $l &gt; 2$. In particular,
the study of high-amplitude and localized scalar fields in axial symmetry is
revealed to be only possible by adding the sixth regularization variable.

    <title>A Model of Muon Anomalies</title>
    <summary>  The Standard Model (SM) is augmented with a $\mathrm{U}(1)_{B-3L_\mu} $ gauge
symmetry spontaneously broken above the TeV scale when an SM-singlet scalar
condenses. Scalar leptoquarks $S_{1(3)} = (\overline{\mathbf{3}},\, \mathbf{1}
(\mathbf{3}),\, ^1\!/_3)$ charged under $\mathrm{U}(1)_{B-3L_\mu} $ mediate the
intriguing effects observed in muon $(g-2)$, $R_{K^{(*)}}$ and $b \to s \mu^+
\mu^-$, while generically evading all other phenomenological constraints. The
fermionic sector is minimally extended with three right-handed neutrinos, and a
successful type-I seesaw mechanism is realized. Charged lepton flavor violation
and proton decay - common predictions of leptoquarks - are postponed to the
dimension-6 effective Lagrangian. Unavoidable radiative corrections in the
Higgs mass and muon Yukawa favor leptoquark masses interesting for collider
searches. The parameters of the model are radiatively stable and can be evolved
by the renormalization group to the Planck scale without inconsistencies.
Alternative models based on a $\mathrm{U}(1)_{L_\mu- L_\tau}$ gauge symmetry
are proposed for comparison.

    <title>More Photos are All You Need: Semi-Supervised Learning for Fine-Grained
  Sketch Based Image Retrieval</title>
    <summary>  A fundamental challenge faced by existing Fine-Grained Sketch-Based Image
Retrieval (FG-SBIR) models is the data scarcity -- model performances are
largely bottlenecked by the lack of sketch-photo pairs. Whilst the number of
photos can be easily scaled, each corresponding sketch still needs to be
individually produced. In this paper, we aim to mitigate such an upper-bound on
sketch data, and study whether unlabelled photos alone (of which they are many)
can be cultivated for performances gain. In particular, we introduce a novel
semi-supervised framework for cross-modal retrieval that can additionally
leverage large-scale unlabelled photos to account for data scarcity. At the
centre of our semi-supervision design is a sequential photo-to-sketch
generation model that aims to generate paired sketches for unlabelled photos.
Importantly, we further introduce a discriminator guided mechanism to guide
against unfaithful generation, together with a distillation loss based
regularizer to provide tolerance against noisy training samples. Last but not
least, we treat generation and retrieval as two conjugate problems, where a
joint learning procedure is devised for each module to mutually benefit from
each other. Extensive experiments show that our semi-supervised model yields
significant performance boost over the state-of-the-art supervised
alternatives, as well as existing methods that can exploit unlabelled photos
for FG-SBIR.

    <title>Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning Based mmWave Beam Prediction in 5G
  and Beyond</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning provides powerful means to learn from spectrum data and solve
complex tasks in 5G and beyond such as beam selection for initial access (IA)
in mmWave communications. To establish the IA between the base station (e.g.,
gNodeB) and user equipment (UE) for directional transmissions, a deep neural
network (DNN) can predict the beam that is best slanted to each UE by using the
received signal strengths (RSSs) from a subset of possible narrow beams. While
improving the latency and reliability of beam selection compared to the
conventional IA that sweeps all beams, the DNN itself is susceptible to
adversarial attacks. We present an adversarial attack by generating adversarial
perturbations to manipulate the over-the-air captured RSSs as the input to the
DNN. This attack reduces the IA performance significantly and fools the DNN
into choosing the beams with small RSSs compared to jamming attacks with
Gaussian or uniform noise.

    <title>Structure theorems for Power Series in Several Complex Variables</title>
    <summary>  It is a classical fact that domains of convergence of power series of several
complex variables are characterized as logarithmically convex complete
Reinhardt domains; let $D \subsetneq \mathbb{C}^N$ be such a domain. We show
that a necessary as well as sufficient condition for a power series $g$ to have
$D$ as its domain of convergence is that it admits a decomposition into
elementary power series i.e., $g$ can be expressed as a sum of a sequence of
power series $g_n$ with the property that each of the logarithmic images $G_n$
of their domains of convergence are half-spaces, all containing the logarithmic
image $G$ of $D$ and such that the largest open subset of $\mathbb{C}^N$ on
which all the $g_n$'s converge absolutely is $D$. In short, every power series
admits a decomposition into elementary power series. The proof of this leads to
a new way of arriving at a constructive proof of the aforementioned classical
fact. This proof inturn leads to another decomposition result in which the
$G_n$'s are now wedges formed by intersections of pairs of supporting
half-spaces of $G$. Along the way, we also show that in each fiber of the
restriction of the absolute map to the boundary of the domain of convergence of
$g$, there exists a singular point of $g$.

    <title>Beurling quotient modules on the polydisc</title>
    <summary>  Let $H^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$ denote the Hardy space over the polydisc
$\mathbb{D}^n$, $n \geq 2$. A closed subspace $\mathcal{Q} \subseteq
H^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$ is called Beurling quotient module if there exists an inner
function $\theta \in H^\infty(\mathbb{D}^n)$ such that $\mathcal{Q} =
H^2(\mathbb{D}^n) /\theta H^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$. We present a complete
characterization of Beurling quotient modules of $H^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$: Let
$\mathcal{Q} \subseteq H^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$ be a closed subspace, and let
$C_{z_i} = P_{\mathcal{Q}} M_{z_i}|_{\mathcal{Q}}$, $i=1, \ldots, n$. Then
$\mathcal{Q}$ is a Beurling quotient module if and only if \[ (I_{\mathcal{Q}}
- C_{z_i}^* C_{z_i}) (I_{\mathcal{Q}} - C_{z_j}^* C_{z_j}) = 0 \qquad (i \neq
j). \] We present two applications: first, we obtain a dilation theorem for
Brehmer $n$-tuples of commuting contractions, and, second, we relate joint
invariant subspaces with factorizations of inner functions. All results work
equally well for general vector-valued Hardy spaces.

    <title>Putting a price on tenure</title>
    <summary>  Government employees in Brazil are granted tenure after three years of taking
their entrance exams. Firing a tenured government employee is all but
impossible, so tenure is a big perquisite. But exactly how big is it? No one
has ever attempted to estimate the monetary equivalent of tenure for Brazilian
government workers. We do that in this paper. We use a modified version of the
Sharpe ratio to estimate what the risk-adjusted salaries of government workers
should be. The difference between actual salary and risk-adjusted salary gives
us an estimate of how much tenure is worth for each employee. We find that the
median value of tenure is R$ 4517 for federal government employees, R$ 2560 for
state government employees, and R$ 672 for municipal government employees.

    <title>The Conformal Anomaly Action to Fourth Order (4T) in $d=4$ in Momentum
  Space</title>
    <summary>  We elaborate on the structure of the conformal anomaly effective action up to
4-th order, in an expansion in the gravitational fluctuations $(h)$ of the
background metric, in the flat spacetime limit. For this purpose we discuss the
renormalization of 4-point functions containing insertions of stress-energy
tensors (TTTT), in conformal field theories in four spacetime dimensions. We
rely on a separation of the correlator into its transverse/traceless and
longitudinal components, applied to its combined conformal, conservation and
trace Ward identities (CWIs) in momentum space. This allows to identify from
the hierarchical structure of the renormalized CWIs the anomaly contribution,
without the need to proceed with a complete determination all of its
independent form factors. Renormalization induces sequential bilinear
graviton-scalar mixings on single, double and multiple trace terms,
corresponding to $R\square^{-1}$ interactions of the scalar curvature, with
intermediate virtual massless exchanges. These dilaton-like terms couple to the
conformal anomaly, as for the chiral anomalous WIs. We show that at 4T level a
new traceless component appears after renormalization. We comment on future
extensions of this result to more general backgrounds, with possible
applications to nonlocal cosmologies.

    <title>A comparative analysis of local network similarity measurements:
  application to author citation networks</title>
    <summary>  Understanding the evolution of paper and author citations is of paramount
importance for the design of research policies and evaluation criteria that can
promote and accelerate scientific discoveries. Recently many studies on the
evolution of science have been conducted in the context of the emergent science
of science field. While many studies have probed the link problem in citation
networks, only a few works have analyzed the temporal nature of link prediction
in author citation networks. In this study we compared the performance of 10
well-known local network similarity measurements to predict future links in
author citations networks. Differently from traditional link prediction
methods, the temporal nature of the predict links is relevant for our approach.
Our analysis revealed interesting results. The Jaccard coefficient was found to
be among the most relevant measurements. The preferential attachment
measurement, conversely, displayed the worst performance. We also found that
the extension of local measurements to their weighted version do not
significantly improved the performance of predicting citations. Finally, we
also found that a neural network approach summarizing the information from all
10 considered similarity measurements was not able to provide the highest
prediction performance.

    <title>Generalized Gibbs Ensemble of 2D CFT with U(1) Charge from the AGT
  Correspondence</title>
    <summary>  The Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) is relevant to understand the
thermalization of quantum systems with an infinite set of conserved charges. In
this work, we analyze the GGE partition function of 2D Conformal Field Theories
(CFTs) with a U(1) charge and quantum Benjamin-Ono$_{2}$ (qBO$_{2}$) hierarchy
charges. We use the Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa (AGT) correspondence to express the
thermal trace in terms of the Alba-Fateev-Litvinov-Tarnopolskiy (AFLT) basis of
descendants, which diagonalizes all charges. We analyze the GGE partition
function in the thermodynamic semiclassical limit, including the first order
quantum correction. We find that the equality between GGE averages and primary
eigenvalues of the qBO$_{2}$ charges is attainable in the strict large $c$
limit and potentially violated at the subleading $1/c$ order. We also obtain
the finite $c$ partition function when only the first non-trivial charge is
turned on, expressed in terms of partial theta functions. Our results should be
relevant to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for charged CFTs, Warped
CFTs and effective field theory descriptions of condensed matter systems.

    <title>QuasarNet: A new research platform for the data-driven investigation of
  black holes</title>
    <summary>  We present Quasarnet, a novel research platform that enables deployment of
data-driven modeling techniques for the investigation of the properties of
super-massive black holes. Black hole data sets -- observations and simulations
-- have grown rapidly in the last decade in both complexity and abundance.
However, our computational environments and tool sets have not matured
commensurately to exhaust opportunities for discovery with these data. Our
pilot study presented here is motivated by one of the fundamental open
questions in understanding black hole formation and assembly across cosmic time
- the nature of the black hole host galaxy and parent dark matter halo
connection. To explore this, we combine and co-locate large, observational data
sets of quasars, the high-redshift luminous population of accreting black
holes, at z &gt; 3 alongside simulated data spanning the same cosmic epochs in
Quasarnet. We demonstrate the extraction of the properties of observed quasars
and their putative dark matter parent halos that permit studying their
association and correspondence. In this paper, we describe the design,
implementation, and operation of the publicly queryable Quasarnet database and
provide examples of query types and visualizations that can be used to explore
the data. Starting with data collated in Quasarnet, which will serve as
training sets, we plan to utilize machine learning algorithms to predict
properties of the as yet undetected, less luminous quasar population. To that
ultimate goal, here we present the first key step in building the
BH-galaxy-halo connection that underpins the formation and evolution of
supermassive black holes. All our codes and compiled data are available on the
public Google Kaggle Platform.

    <title>Infinite Stable Graphs With Large Chromatic Number II</title>
    <summary>  We prove a version of the strong Taylor's conjecture for stable graphs: if
$G$ is a stable graph whose chromatic number is strictly greater than
$\beth_2(\aleph_0)$ then $G$ contains all finite subgraphs of Sh$_n(\omega)$
and thus has elementary extensions of unbounded chromatic number. This
completes the picture from our previous work. The main new model theoretic
ingredient is a generalization of the classical construction of
Ehrenfeucht-Mostowski models to an infinitary setting, giving a new
characterization of stability.

    <title>Maximal Intervals of Decrease and Inflection Points for Node Reliability</title>
    <summary>  The \textit{node reliability} of a graph $G$ is the probability that at least
one node is operational and that the operational nodes can all communicate in
the subgraph that they induce, given that the edges are perfectly reliable but
each node operates independently with probability $p\in[0,1]$. We show that
unlike many other notions of graph reliability, the number of maximal intervals
of decrease in $[0,1]$ is unbounded, and that there can be arbitrarily many
inflection points in the interval as well.

    <title>A Characterization of Non-Iterative Normal Modal Logics</title>
    <summary>  Non-iterative normal modal logics are defined by axioms of modal degree 1. In
this paper we use calculations with normal forms to determine the set of all
possible non-iterative normal modal logics, unimodal propositional extensions
of K. To characterize them, we construct the complete set (lattice) of such
logics and we provide the generic specification of their axioms and their
semantics.

    <title>Cosmological implications of the anisotropy of ten galaxy cluster
  scaling relations</title>
    <summary>  The hypothesis that the late Universe is isotropic and homogeneous is adopted
by most cosmological studies. The expansion rate $H_0$ is thought to be
spatially constant, while bulk flows are often presumed to be negligible
compared to the Hubble expansion, even at local scales. Their effects on the
redshift-distance conversion are hence usually ignored. Any deviation from this
consensus can strongly bias the results of such studies and thus the importance
of testing these assumptions cannot be understated. Scaling relations of galaxy
clusters can be effectively used for that. In previous works, we observed
strong anisotropies in cluster scaling relations, whose origins remain
ambiguous. By measuring many different cluster properties, several scaling
relations with different sensitivities can be built. Nearly independent tests
of cosmic isotropy and bulk flows are then feasible. We make use of up to 570
clusters with measured properties at X-ray, microwave, and infrared
wavelengths, to construct 10 different cluster scaling relations (five of them
presented for the first time) and test the isotropy of the local Universe.
Through rigorous tests, we ensure that our analysis is not prone to generally
known systematic biases and X-ray absorption issues. By combining all available
information, we detect an apparent $9\%$ spatial variation in the local $H_0$
between $(l,b)\sim
({280^{\circ}}^{+35^{\circ}}_{-35^{\circ}},{-15^{\circ}}^{+20^{\circ}}_{-20^{\circ}})$
and the rest of the sky. The observed anisotropy has a nearly dipole form.
Using Monte Carlo simulations, we assess the statistical significance of the
anisotropy to be $&gt;5\sigma$. This result could also be attributed to a $\sim
900$ km/s bulk flow which seems to extend out to at least $\sim 500$ Mpc. These
two effects are indistinguishable until more high$-z$ clusters are observed by
future all-sky surveys, such as eROSITA.

    <title>Logarithmic law of large random correlation matrix</title>
    <summary>  Consider a random vector $\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{\Sigma}^{1/2}\mathbf{x}$, where
the $p$ elements of the vector $\mathbf{x}$ are i.i.d. real-valued random
variables with zero mean and finite fourth moment, and $\mathbf{\Sigma}^{1/2}$
is a deterministic $p\times p$ matrix such that the spectral norm of the
population correlation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ of $\mathbf{y}$ is uniformly
bounded. In this paper, we find that the log determinant of the sample
correlation matrix $\hat{\mathbf{R}}$ based on a sample of size $n$ from the
distribution of $\mathbf{y}$ satisfies a CLT (central limit theorem) for
$p/n\to \gamma\in (0, 1]$ and $p\leq n$. Explicit formulas for the asymptotic
mean and variance are provided. In case the mean of $\mathbf{y}$ is unknown, we
show that after recentering by the empirical mean the obtained CLT holds with a
shift in the asymptotic mean. This result is of independent interest in both
large dimensional random matrix theory and high-dimensional statistical
literature of large sample correlation matrices for non-normal data. At last,
the obtained findings are applied for testing of uncorrelatedness of $p$ random
variables. Surprisingly, in the null case $\mathbf{R}=\mathbf{I}$, the test
statistic becomes completely pivotal and the extensive simulations show that
the obtained CLT also holds if the moments of order four do not exist at all,
which conjectures a promising and robust test statistic for heavy-tailed
high-dimensional data.

    <title>A unified formalism to study $soft$ as well as $hard$ part of the
  transverse momentum spectra</title>
    <summary>  Transverse momentum $p_T$ spectra of final state particles produced in high
energy heavy-ion collision can be divided into two distinct regions based on
the difference in the underlying particle production process. We have provided
a unified formalism to explain both low- and high-$p_T$ regime of spectra in a
consistent manner. The $p_T$ spectra of final state particles produced at RHIC
and LHC energies have been analysed using unified formalism to test its
applicability at different energies, and a good agreement with the data is
obtained across all energies. Further, the prospect of extracting the elliptic
flow coefficient directly from the transverse momentum spectra is explored.

    <title>Boosting Binary Masks for Multi-Domain Learning through Affine
  Transformations</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we present a new, algorithm for multi-domain learning. Given a
pretrained architecture and a set of visual domains received sequentially, the
goal of multi-domain learning is to produce a single model performing a task in
all the domains together. Recent works showed how we can address this problem
by masking the internal weights of a given original conv-net through learned
binary variables. In this work, we provide a general formulation of binary mask
based models for multi-domain learning by affine transformations of the
original network parameters. Our formulation obtains significantly higher
levels of adaptation to new domains, achieving performances comparable to
domain-specific models while requiring slightly more than 1 bit per network
parameter per additional domain. Experiments on two popular benchmarks showcase
the power of our approach, achieving performances close to state-of-the-art
methods on the Visual Decathlon Challenge.

    <title>Transmit Beamspace DDMA Based Automotive MIMO Radar</title>
    <summary>  The time division multiple access (TDMA) technique has been applied in
automotive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. However, it suffers
from the transmit energy loss, and as a result the parameter estimation
performance degradation when the number of transmit elements increases. To
tackle these problem, a transmit beamspace (TB) Doppler division multiple
access (DDMA) approach is proposed. First, a phase modulation matrix with empty
Doppler spectrum is introduced. By exploiting the empty Doppler spectrum, a
test function based on sequential detection is developed to mitigate the
Doppler ambiguity in DDMA waveform. Then, a discrete Fourier transform
(DFT)-based TB in slow-time is formed.The proposed method can achieve waveform
diversity in Doppler domain and generate a TB in slow-time that concentrates
the transmitted power in a fixed spatial region to improve the transmit energy
distribution for automotive MIMO radar, which is favored by medium/long range
radar (MRR/LRR) applications. As compared to the conventional TDMA technique,
the proposed TB DDMA approach can fully exploit the transmission capabilities
of all transmit elements to ensure that the emitted power is efficiently used
and inherits easy implementation. Moreover, the proposed TB DDMA method avoids
the trade-off between the active time for each transmit antenna and the frame
time. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed TB DDMA
approach for automotive MIMO radar.

    <title>A Matrix-free Multigrid Preconditioner for Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov
  Methods</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we propose a multigrid preconditioner for Jacobian-free
Newton-Krylov (JFNK) methods. Our multigrid method does not require to store
any representation of the Jacobian at any level of the multigrid hierarchy. As
it is common in standard multigrid methods, the proposed method also relies on
three building blocks: transfer operators, smoothers, and a coarse level
solver. In addition to the restriction and prolongation operator, we also use a
projection operator to transfer the current Newton iterate to a coarser level.
The three-level Chebyshev semi-iterative method is employed as a smoother, as
it has good smoothing properties and does not require the representation of the
Jacobian matrix. We replace the direct solver on the coarsest-level with a
matrix-free Krylov subspace method, thus giving rise to a truly Jacobian-free
multigrid preconditioner. We will discuss all building blocks of our multigrid
preconditioner in detail and demonstrate the robustness and the efficiency of
the proposed method using several numerical examples.

    <title>On a theorem of Chernoff on rank one Riemannian symmetric spaces</title>
    <summary>  In 1975, P.R. Chernoff used iterates of the Laplacian on $\mathbb{R}^n$ to
prove an $L^2$ version of the Denjoy-Carleman theorem which provides a
sufficient condition for a smooth function on $\mathbb{R}^n$ to be
quasi-analytic. In this paper, we prove an exact analogue of Chernoff's theorem
for all rank one Riemannian symmetric spaces (of noncompact and compact types)
using iterates of the associated Laplace-Beltrami operators.

    <title>Inferring Latent Domains for Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation</title>
    <summary>  Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) refers to the problem of learning a
model in a target domain where labeled data are not available by leveraging
information from annotated data in a source domain. Most deep UDA approaches
operate in a single-source, single-target scenario, i.e. they assume that the
source and the target samples arise from a single distribution. However, in
practice most datasets can be regarded as mixtures of multiple domains. In
these cases, exploiting traditional single-source, single-target methods for
learning classification models may lead to poor results. Furthermore, it is
often difficult to provide the domain labels for all data points, i.e. latent
domains should be automatically discovered. This paper introduces a novel deep
architecture which addresses the problem of UDA by automatically discovering
latent domains in visual datasets and exploiting this information to learn
robust target classifiers. Specifically, our architecture is based on two main
components, i.e. a side branch that automatically computes the assignment of
each sample to its latent domain and novel layers that exploit domain
membership information to appropriately align the distribution of the CNN
internal feature representations to a reference distribution. We evaluate our
approach on publicly available benchmarks, showing that it outperforms
state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.

    <title>Measurement Error Mitigation via Truncated Neumann Series</title>
    <summary>  Measurements on near-term quantum processors are inevitably subject to
hardware imperfections that lead to readout errors. Mitigation of such
unavoidable errors is crucial to better explore and extend the power of
near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we propose a method to mitigate
measurement errors in computing quantum expectation values using the truncated
Neumann series. The essential idea is to cancel the errors by combining various
noisy expectation values generated by sequential measurements determined by
terms in the truncated series. We numerically test this method and find that
the computation accuracy is substantially improved. Our method possesses
several advantages: it does not assume any noise structure, it does not require
the calibration procedure to learn the noise matrix a prior, and most
importantly, the incurred error mitigation overhead is independent of system
size, as long as the noise resistance of the measurement device is moderate.
All these advantages empower our method as a practical measurement error
mitigation method for near-term quantum devices.

    <title>Physics-informed Learning for Identification and State Reconstruction of
  Traffic Density</title>
    <summary>  This paper deals with traffic density reconstruction using measurements from
Probe Vehicles (PVs). The main difficulty arises when considering a low
penetration rate, meaning that the number of PVs is small compared to the total
number of vehicles on the road. Moreover, the formulation assumes noisy
measurements and a partially unknown first-order model. All these
considerations make the use of machine learning to reconstruct the state the
only applicable solution. We first investigate how the identification and
reconstruction processes can be merged and how a sparse dataset can still
enable a good identification. Secondly, we propose a pre-training procedure
that helps the hyperparameter tuning, preventing the gradient descent algorithm
from getting stuck at saddle points. Examples using numerical simulations and
the SUMO traffic simulator show that the reconstructions are close to the real
density in all cases.

    <title>Deep Learning with robustness to missing data: A novel approach to the
  detection of COVID-19</title>
    <summary>  In the context of the current global pandemic and the limitations of the
RT-PCR test, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, DFCN, (Denoising
Fully Connected Network) for the detection of COVID-19 using laboratory tests
and chest x-rays. Since medical facilities around the world differ enormously
in what laboratory tests or chest imaging may be available, DFCN is designed to
be robust to missing input data. An ablation study extensively evaluates the
performance benefits of the DFCN architecture as well as its robustness to
missing inputs. Data from 1088 patients with confirmed RT-PCR results are
obtained from two independent medical facilities. The data collected includes
results from 27 laboratory tests and a chest x-ray scored by a deep learning
network. Training and test datasets are defined based on the source medical
facility. Data is made publicly available. The performance of DFCN in
predicting the RT-PCR result is compared with 3 related architectures as well
as a Random Forest baseline. All models are trained with varying levels of
masked input data to encourage robustness to missing inputs. Missing data is
simulated at test time by masking inputs randomly. Using area under the
receiver operating curve (AUC) as a metric, DFCN outperforms all other models
with statistical significance using random subsets of input data with 2-27
available inputs. When all 28 inputs are available DFCN obtains an AUC of
0.924, higher than achieved by any other model. Furthermore, with clinically
meaningful subsets of parameters consisting of just 6 and 7 inputs
respectively, DFCN also achieves higher AUCs than any other model, with values
of 0.909 and 0.919.

    <title>Characterization and computation of control invariant sets within target
  regions for linear impulsive control systems</title>
    <summary>  Linear impulsively controlled systems are suitable to describe a venue of
real-life problems, going from disease treatment to aerospace guidance. The
main characteristic of such systems is that they remain uncontrolled for
certain periods of time. As a consequence, punctual equilibria
characterizations outside the origin are no longer useful, and the whole
concept of equilibrium and its natural extension, the controlled invariant
sets, needs to be redefined. Also, an exact characterization of the admissible
states, i.e., states such that their uncontrolled evolution between impulse
times remain within a predefined set, is required. An approach to such tasks --
based on the Markov-Lukasz theorem -- is presented, providing a tractable and
non-conservative characterization, emerging from polynomial positivity that has
application to systems with rational eigenvalues. This is in turn the basis for
obtaining a tractable approximation to the maximal admissible invariant sets.
In this work, it is also demonstrated that, in order for the problem to have a
solution, an invariant set (and moreover, an equilibrium set) must be contained
within the target zone. To assess the proposal, the so-obtained impulsive
invariant set is explicitly used in the formulation of a set-based model
predictive controller, with application to zone tracking. In this context,
specific MPC theory needs to be considered, as the target is not necessarily
stable in the sense of Lyapunov. A zone MPC formulation is proposed, which is
able to i) track an invariant set such that the uncontrolled propagation
fulfills the zone constraint at all times and ii) converge asymptotically to
the set of periodic orbits completely contained within the target zone.

    <title>Model Order Reduction based on Runge-Kutta Neural Network</title>
    <summary>  Model Order Reduction (MOR) methods enable the generation of
real-time-capable digital twins, which can enable various novel value streams
in industry. While traditional projection-based methods are robust and accurate
for linear problems, incorporating Machine Learning to deal with nonlinearity
becomes a new choice for reducing complex problems. Such methods usually
consist of two steps. The first step is dimension reduction by projection-based
method, and the second is the model reconstruction by Neural Network. In this
work, we apply some modifications for both steps respectively and investigate
how they are impacted by testing with three simulation models. In all cases
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is used for dimension reduction. For this
step, the effects of generating the input snapshot database with constant input
parameters is compared with time-dependent input parameters. For the model
reconstruction step, two types of neural network architectures are compared:
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Runge-Kutta Neural Network (RKNN). The MLP
learns the system state directly while RKNN learns the derivative of system
state and predicts the new state as a Runge-Kutta integrator.

    <title>Bertinho: Galician BERT Representations</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents a monolingual BERT model for Galician. We follow the
recent trend that shows that it is feasible to build robust monolingual BERT
models even for relatively low-resource languages, while performing better than
the well-known official multilingual BERT (mBERT). More particularly, we
release two monolingual Galician BERT models, built using 6 and 12 transformer
layers, respectively; trained with limited resources (~45 million tokens on a
single GPU of 24GB). We then provide an exhaustive evaluation on a number of
tasks such as POS-tagging, dependency parsing and named entity recognition. For
this purpose, all these tasks are cast in a pure sequence labeling setup in
order to run BERT without the need to include any additional layers on top of
it (we only use an output classification layer to map the contextualized
representations into the predicted label). The experiments show that our
models, especially the 12-layer one, outperform the results of mBERT in most
tasks.

    <title>Improving Playtesting Coverage via Curiosity Driven Reinforcement
  Learning Agents</title>
    <summary>  As modern games continue growing both in size and complexity, it has become
more challenging to ensure that all the relevant content is tested and that any
potential issue is properly identified and fixed. Attempting to maximize
testing coverage using only human participants, however, results in a tedious
and hard to orchestrate process which normally slows down the development
cycle. Complementing playtesting via autonomous agents has shown great promise
accelerating and simplifying this process. This paper addresses the problem of
automatically exploring and testing a given scenario using reinforcement
learning agents trained to maximize game state coverage. Each of these agents
is rewarded based on the novelty of its actions, thus encouraging a curious and
exploratory behaviour on a complex 3D scenario where previously proposed
exploration techniques perform poorly. The curious agents are able to learn the
complex navigation mechanics required to reach the different areas around the
map, thus providing the necessary data to identify potential issues. Moreover,
the paper also explores different visualization strategies and evaluates how to
make better use of the collected data to drive design decisions and to
recognize possible problems and oversights.

    <title>Multi-frame Super-resolution from Noisy Data</title>
    <summary>  Obtaining high resolution images from low resolution data with clipped noise
is algorithmically challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. So
far such problems have hardly been tackled, and the few existing approaches use
simplistic regularisers. We show the usefulness of two adaptive regularisers
based on anisotropic diffusion ideas: Apart from evaluating the classical
edge-enhancing anisotropic diffusion regulariser, we introduce a novel
non-local one with one-sided differences and superior performance. It is termed
sector diffusion. We combine it with all six variants of the classical
super-resolution observational model that arise from permutations of its three
operators for warping, blurring, and downsampling. Surprisingly, the evaluation
in a practically relevant noisy scenario produces a different ranking than the
one in the noise-free setting in our previous work (SSVM 2017).

    <title>Sharp growth conditions for boundedness of maximal function in
  generalized Orlicz spaces</title>
    <summary>  We study sharp growth conditions for the boundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood
maximal function in the generalized Orlicz spaces. We assume that the
generalized Orlicz function $\phi(x, t)$ satisfies the standard continuity
properties (A0), (A1) and (A2). We show that if the Hardy-Littlewood maximal
function is bounded from the generalized Orlicz space to itself then
$\phi(x,t)/ t^p$ is almost increasing for large $t$ for some $p&gt;1$. Moreover we
show that the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function is bounded from the generalized
Orlicz space $L^\phi(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to itself if and only if $\phi$ is weakly
equivalent to a generalized Orlicz function $\psi$ satisfying (A0), (A1) and
(A2) for which $\psi(x,t)/ t^p$ is almost increasing for all $t&gt;0$ and some
$p&gt;1$.

    <title>Complete set of bound negative-parity states in the neutron-rich 18N
  nucleus</title>
    <summary>  High-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy of 18N is performed with the Advanced
GAmma Tracking Array AGATA, following deep-inelastic processes induced by an
18O beam on a 181Ta target. Six states are newly identified, which together
with the three known excitations exhaust all negative-parity excited states
expected in 18N below the neutron threshold. Spin and parities are proposed for
all located states on the basis of decay branchings and comparison with
large-scale shell-model calculations performed in the p-sd space, with the YSOX
interaction. Of particular interest is the location of the 0^-_1 and 1^-_2
excitations, which provide strong constrains for cross-shell p-sd matrix
elements based on realistic interactions, and help to simultaneously reproduce
the ground and first-excited states in 16N and 18N, for the first time.
Understanding the 18N structure has significant impact on neutron-capture
cross-section calculations in r-process modeling including light neutron-rich
nuclei.

    <title>Absence of superconductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
    <summary>  The possibility of the superconducting transition in the two-dimensional
repulsive Hubbard model is studied using the ladder approximation of the strong
coupling diagram technique. The $t$-$U$ and $t$-$t'$-$t''$-$U$ models are
considered in the regime of strong correlations, for the on-site Coulomb
repulsion $U=8t$, in the range of temperatures $0.02t\lesssim T\lesssim 0.3t$.
To avoid the influence of the phase separation and size effects the
calculations are performed in an infinite crystal, in the part of the phase
diagram without inhomogeneities, for the electron concentration $\bar{n}
=0.92$. Solutions of the Eliashberg equation for singlet and triplet pairing,
which are transformed according to one-dimensional representations of the
lattice point group $D_4$, are considered. For both models and all considered
symmetries, eigenvalues of the Eliashberg equation are less than unity and
demonstrate no upward trend with decreasing temperature. This result points to
the absence of superconductivity in the Hubbard model in the strong-coupling
regime. We discuss the reason for the small eigenvalue of the Eliashberg
equation in the case of the singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing.

    <title>Accurate 3D fireball trajectory and orbit calculation using the
  3D-FireTOC automatic Python code</title>
    <summary>  The disruption of asteroids and comets produces cm-sized meteoroids that end
up impacting the Earth's atmosphere and producing bright fireballs that might
have associated shock waves or, in geometrically-favorable occasions excavate
craters that put them into unexpected hazardous scenarios. The astrometric
reduction of meteors and fireballs to infer their atmospheric trajectories and
heliocentric orbits involves a complex and tedious process that generally
requires many manual tasks. To streamline the process, we present a software
package called SPMN 3D Fireball Trajectory and Orbit Calculator (3D-FireTOC),
an automatic Python code for detection, trajectory reconstruction of meteors,
and heliocentric orbit computation from video recordings. The automatic
3D-FireTOC package comprises of a user interface and a graphic engine that
generates a realistic 3D representation model, which allows users to easily
check the geometric consistency of the results and facilitates scientific
content production for dissemination. The software automatically detects
meteors from digital systems, completes the astrometric measurements, performs
photometry, computes the meteor atmospheric trajectory, calculates the velocity
curve, and obtains the radiant and the heliocentric orbit, all in all
quantifying the error measurements in each step. The software applies
corrections such as light aberration, refraction, zenith attraction, diurnal
aberration and atmospheric extinction. It also characterizes the atmospheric
flight and consequently determines fireball fates by using the $\alpha - \beta$
criterion that analyses the ability of a fireball to penetrate deep into the
atmosphere and produce meteorites. We demonstrate the performance of the
software by analyzing two bright fireballs recorded by the Spanish Fireball and
Meteorite Network (SPMN).

    <title>Video Instance Segmentation with a Propose-Reduce Paradigm</title>
    <summary>  Video instance segmentation (VIS) aims to segment and associate all instances
of predefined classes for each frame in videos. Prior methods usually obtain
segmentation for a frame or clip first, and then merge the incomplete results
by tracking or matching. These methods may cause error accumulation in the
merging step. Contrarily, we propose a new paradigm -- Propose-Reduce, to
generate complete sequences for input videos by a single step. We further build
a sequence propagation head on the existing image-level instance segmentation
network for long-term propagation. To ensure robustness and high recall of our
proposed framework, multiple sequences are proposed where redundant sequences
of the same instance are reduced. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on
two representative benchmark datasets -- we obtain 47.6% in terms of AP on
YouTube-VIS validation set and 70.4% for J&amp;F on DAVIS-UVOS validation set.

    <title>On a formula of Thompson and McEnteggert for the adjugate matrix</title>
    <summary>  For an eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ of a Hermitian matrix $A$, the formula of
Thompson and McEnteggert gives an explicit expression of the adjoint of
$\lambda_0 I-A$, $\mathrm{adj}(\lambda_0 I-A)$, in terms of eigenvectors of $A$
for $\lambda_0$ and all its eigenvalues. In this paper Thompson-McEnteggert's
formula is generalized to include any matrix with entries in an arbitrary
field. In addition, for any nonsingular matrix $A$, a formula for the
elementary divisors of $\mathrm{adj}(A)$ is provided in terms of those of $A$.
Finally, a generalization of the eigenvalue-eigenvector identity and two
applications of the Thompson-McEnteggert's formula are presented.

    <title>Gradings allowing wild automorphisms</title>
    <summary>  In 2004 Shestakov and Umirbaev proved that the Nagata automorphism of the
polynomial algebra in three variables is wild. We fix a Z-grading on this
algebra and consider graded-wild automorphisms, i.e. such automorphisms that
can not be decomposed onto elementary automorphisms respecting the grading. We
describe all gradings allowing graded-wild automorphisms.

    <title>New binaries from the SHINE survey</title>
    <summary>  We present the multiple stellar systems observed within the SpHere INfrared
survey for Exoplanet (SHINE). SHINE searched for substellar companions to young
stars using high contrast imaging. Although stars with known stellar companions
within SPHERE field of view (&lt;5.5 arcsec) were removed from the original target
list, we detected additional stellar companions to 78 of the 463 SHINE targets
observed so far. 27% of the systems have three or more components. Given the
heterogeneity of the sample in terms of observing conditions and strategy,
tailored routines were used for data reduction and analysis, some of which were
specifically designed for these data sets. We then combined SPHERE data with
literature and archival ones, TESS light curves and Gaia parallaxes and proper
motions, to characterise these systems as completely as possible. Combining all
data, we were able to constrain the orbits of 25 systems. We carefully assessed
the completeness of our sample for the separation range 50-500 mas (period
range a few years - a few tens of years), taking into account the initial
selection biases and recovering part of the systems excluded from the original
list due to their multiplicity. This allowed us to compare the binary frequency
for our sample with previous studies and highlight some interesting trends in
the mass ratio and period distribution. We also found that, for the few objects
for which such estimate was possible, the values of the masses derived from
dynamical arguments were in good agreement with the model predictions. Stellar
and orbital spins appear fairly well aligned for the 12 stars having enough
data, which favour a disk fragmentation origin. Our results highlight the
importance of combining different techniques when tackling complex problems
such as the formation of binaries and show how large samples can be useful for
more than one purpose.

    <title>Occurrence rate of radio-loud and halo CMEs in solar cycle 25:
  Prediction using their correlation with sunspot numbers</title>
    <summary>  The coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun are known for their space
weather and geomagnetic consequences. Among all CMEs, so-called radio-loud (RL)
and halo CMEs are considered the most energetic in the sense that they are
usually faster and wider than the general population of CMEs. Hence the study
of RL and halo CMEs has become important and the prediction of their occurrence
rate in a future cycle will give a warning in advance. In the present paper,
the occurrence rates of RL and halo CMEs in solar cycle (SC) 25 are predicted.
For this, we obtained good correlations between the numbers of RL and halo CMEs
in each year and the yearly mean sunspot numbers in the previous two cycles.
The predicted values of sunspot numbers in SC 25 by NOAA/NASA were considered
as representative indices and the corresponding numbers of RL and halo CMEs
have been determined using linear relations. Our results show that the maximum
number of RL and halo CMEs will be around 39 $/pm$ 3 and 45 $/pm$ 4,
respectively. Removing backside events, a set of front-side events was also
considered separately and the front-side events alone in SC 25 are predicted
again. The peak values of front-side RL and halo events have been estimated to
be around 31 $/pm$ 3 and 29 $/pm$ 3 respectively. These results are discussed
in comparison with the predicted values of sunspots by different authors.

    <title>On Bernstein Type Exponential Inequalities for Matrix Martingales</title>
    <summary>  In this work, Bernstein's concentration inequalities for squared integrable
matrix-valued discrete-time martingales are obtained. Based on Lieb's theory
and Bernstein's condition, a suitable supermartingale can be constructed. Our
proof is largely based on this new exponential supermartingale, Freedman's
method, and Doob's stopping theorem. Our result can be regarded as an extension
of Tropp's work (ECP, 2012).

    <title>MCTSteg: A Monte Carlo Tree Search-based Reinforcement Learning
  Framework for Universal Non-additive Steganography</title>
    <summary>  Recent research has shown that non-additive image steganographic frameworks
effectively improve security performance through adjusting distortion
distribution. However, as far as we know, all of the existing non-additive
proposals are based on handcrafted policies, and can only be applied to a
specific image domain, which heavily prevent non-additive steganography from
releasing its full potentiality. In this paper, we propose an automatic
non-additive steganographic distortion learning framework called MCTSteg to
remove the above restrictions. Guided by the reinforcement learning paradigm,
we combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and steganalyzer-based environmental
model to build MCTSteg. MCTS makes sequential decisions to adjust distortion
distribution without human intervention. Our proposed environmental model is
used to obtain feedbacks from each decision. Due to its self-learning
characteristic and domain-independent reward function, MCTSteg has become the
first reported universal non-additive steganographic framework which can work
in both spatial and JPEG domains. Extensive experimental results show that
MCTSteg can effectively withstand the detection of both hand-crafted
feature-based and deep-learning-based steganalyzers. In both spatial and JPEG
domains, the security performance of MCTSteg steadily outperforms the state of
the art by a clear margin under different scenarios.

    <title>Explainability Guided Multi-Site COVID-19 CT Classification</title>
    <summary>  Radiologist examination of chest CT is an effective way for screening
COVID-19 cases. In this work, we overcome three challenges in the automation of
this process: (i) the limited number of supervised positive cases, (ii) the
lack of region-based supervision, and (iii) the variability across acquisition
sites. These challenges are met by incorporating a recent augmentation solution
called SnapMix, by a new patch embedding technique, and by performing a
test-time stability analysis. The three techniques are complementary and are
all based on utilizing the heatmaps produced by the Class Activation Mapping
(CAM) explainability method. Compared to the current state of the art, we
obtain an increase of five percent in the F1 score on a site with a relatively
high number of cases, and a gap twice as large for a site with much fewer
training images.

    <title>Existence and stability of dissipative turbulent solutions to a simple
  bi-fluid model of compressible fluids</title>
    <summary>  Following Abbatiello et al. [ DCCDS-A (41), 2020], we introduce dissipative
turbulent solutions to a simple model of a mixture of two non interacting
compressible fluids {\tc filling a bounded domain with general non zero
inflow/outflow boundary conditions.} We prove existence of such solutions for
all adiabatic coefficients $\gamma&gt;1$, their compatibility with classical
solutions, the relative energy inequality, and the weak strong uniqueness
principle in this class. The class of dissipative turbulent solutions is so far
the largest class of generalized solutions which still enjoys the weak strong
uniqueness property.

    <title>Frame-rate Up-conversion Detection Based on Convolutional Neural Network
  for Learning Spatiotemporal Features</title>
    <summary>  With the advance in user-friendly and powerful video editing tools, anyone
can easily manipulate videos without leaving prominent visual traces.
Frame-rate up-conversion (FRUC), a representative temporal-domain operation,
increases the motion continuity of videos with a lower frame-rate and is used
by malicious counterfeiters in video tampering such as generating fake
frame-rate video without improving the quality or mixing temporally spliced
videos. FRUC is based on frame interpolation schemes and subtle artifacts that
remain in interpolated frames are often difficult to distinguish. Hence,
detecting such forgery traces is a critical issue in video forensics. This
paper proposes a frame-rate conversion detection network (FCDNet) that learns
forensic features caused by FRUC in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed network
uses a stack of consecutive frames as the input and effectively learns
interpolation artifacts using network blocks to learn spatiotemporal features.
This study is the first attempt to apply a neural network to the detection of
FRUC. Moreover, it can cover the following three types of frame interpolation
schemes: nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation, and
motion-compensated interpolation. In contrast to existing methods that exploit
all frames to verify integrity, the proposed approach achieves a high detection
speed because it observes only six frames to test its authenticity. Extensive
experiments were conducted with conventional forensic methods and neural
networks for video forensic tasks to validate our research. The proposed
network achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of detecting the
interpolated artifacts of FRUC. The experimental results also demonstrate that
our trained model is robust for an unseen dataset, unlearned frame-rate, and
unlearned quality factor.

    <title>Actuator Fault-Tolerant Vehicle Motion Control: A Survey</title>
    <summary>  The advent of automated vehicles operating at SAE levels 4 and 5 poses high
fault tolerance demands for all functions contributing to the driving task. At
the actuator level, fault-tolerant vehicle motion control, which exploits
functional redundancies among the actuators, is one means to achieve the
required degree of fault tolerance. Therefore, we give a comprehensive overview
of the state of the art in actuator fault-tolerant vehicle motion control with
a focus on drive, brake, and steering degradations, as well as tire blowouts.
This review shows that actuator fault-tolerant vehicle motion is a widely
studied field; yet, the presented approaches differ with respect to many
aspects. To provide a starting point for future research, we survey the
employed actuator topologies, the tolerated degradations, the presented control
approaches, as well as the experiments conducted for validation. Overall, and
despite the large number of different approaches, the covered literature
reveals the potential of increasing fault tolerance by fault-tolerant vehicle
motion control. Thus, besides developing novel approaches or demonstrating
real-time applicability, future research should aim at investigating
limitations and enabling comparison of fault-tolerant motion control approaches
in order to allow for a thorough safety argumentation.

    <title>Multi-Execution Lattices Fast and Slow</title>
    <summary>  Methods for automatically, soundly, and precisely guaranteeing the
noninterference security policy are predominantly based on multi-execution. All
other methods are either based on undecidable theorem proving or suffer from
false alarms. The multi-execution mechanisms, meanwhile, work by isolating
security levels during program execution and running multiple copies of the
target program, once for each security level with carefully tailored inputs
that ensure both soundness and precision. When security levels are
hierarchically organised in a lattice, this may lead to an exponential number
of executions of the target program as the number of possible ways of combining
security levels grows. In this paper we study how the lattice structure for
security levels influences the runtime overhead of multi-execution. We
additionally show how to use Galois connections to gain speedups in
multi-execution by switching from lattices with high overhead to lattices with
low overhead. Additionally, we give an empirical evaluation that corroborates
our analysis and shows how Galois connections have potential to speed up
multi-execution.

    <title>Evaluation of Sampling-Based Optimizing Planners for Outdoor Robot
  Navigation</title>
    <summary>  Sampling-Based Optimal(SBO) path planning has been mainly used for robotic
arm manipulation tasks. Several research works have been carried out in order
to evaluate performances of various SBO planners for arm manipulation. However,
not much of work is available that highlights performances of SBO planners in
context of mobile robot navigation in outdoor 3D environments. This paper
evaluates performances of major SBO planners in Open Motion Planning
Library(OMPL) for that purpose. Due to large number of existing SBO planners,
experimenting and selecting a proper planner for a planning problem can be
burdensome and ambiguous. SBO planner's probabilistic nature can also add a
bias to this procedure. To address this, we evaluate performances of all
available SBO planners in OMPL with a randomized planning problem generation
method iteratively. Evaluations are done in various state spaces suiting for
different differential constraints of mobile robots. The planning setups are
focused for navigation of mobile robots in outdoor environments. The outdoor
environment representation is done with prebuilt OctoMaps, collision checks are
performed between a 3D box representing robot body and OctoMap for validation
of sampled states. Several evaluation metrics such as resulting path's length,
smoothness and status of acquired final solutions are selected. According to
selected metrics, performances from different SBO planners are presented
comparatively. Experimental results shows the significance of parallel
computing towards quicker convergence rates for optimal solutions. Several SBO
methods that takes advantage of parallel computing produced better results
consistently in all state spaces for different planning inquiries.

    <title>On the phase behaviour of pure PSPC and PEGylated multi-component lipid
  and their interaction with Paclitaxel: An all-atom MD study</title>
    <summary>  The study of the structural behaviour of pure and multi-component lipids at
various temperatures and the interaction of these multi-component lipids with
pharmaceutically important drugs carry huge importance. Here, we investigated
the phase behaviour of the pure PSPC
(1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), and multicomponent PSPC
and
DSPE-PEG2000(1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N[amino(polyethylene
glycol)-2000]) membranes at seven different temperatures ranging from 280 K to
360 K, and calculated their structural properties. We observe a transition from
the gel phase to the liquid crystalline phase between 320 K and 330 K in
agreement with experimental reports for pure PSPC. PSPC remained in the tilted
gel phase L\b{eta}$'$ at 320 K and 310 K, entered the 'mixed ordered' domain
with a partially interdigitated region at 300 K, and finally formed the sub gel
phase at 280 K. We studied the self-assembly for the multicomponent PSPC and
DSPE-PEG2000 membranes and found the coexistence of ordered and disordered
phases at 320 K. In comparison to the pure PSPC, for multicomponent system,
this transition was gradual, and a complete liquid crystalline to gel phase
transformation occurred between 320 K and 310 K. We further studied the
interaction of Paclitaxel with pure PSPC and PEGylated multicomponent lipid
bilayers using umbrella sampling technique and observed PEG promotes the
interaction of Paclitaxel with the later one in comparison to the former. Above
the bilayer transition temperature, Paclitaxel interacts more with the bilayer
and enters inside the bilayer easily for both systems. Understanding of
structural and interaction behaviour of the PEGylated multicomponent lipid
bilayers with Paclitaxel will help explore Paclitaxel based drug applications
in the future.

    <title>Unveiling the broadband spectral and temporal properties of PKS\,0903-57
  during its brightest flare</title>
    <summary>  We carried a detailed spectral and temporal study of blazar,
\mbox{PKS\,0903-57} using the \emph{Fermi}-LAT and \emph{Swift}-XRT/UVOT
observations, during its brightest flaring period MJD\,58931--58970. During
this period, the maximum daily averaged $\gamma$-ray flux ($\rm
F_{0.1-500\,GeV}$) of $\rm9.42\times10^{-6}\,ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ is observed
on MJD\,58951.5, the highest $\gamma$-ray flux detected from
\mbox{PKS\,0903-57} till now. Several high-energy (HE) photons ($&gt;\,10$\,GeV)
consistent with the source location at high probability (&gt;\,99\%) are detected,
and the $\gamma$-ray lightcurve in the active state shows multiple
substructures with asymmetric profile. In order to understand the possible
physical scenario responsible for the flux enhancement, we carried a detailed
broadband spectral study of \mbox{PKS\,0903-57} by choosing different flux
states from its active period. Neglecting the multi-band variability in each of
the selected time intervals, we could reproduce their averaged broadband SEDs
with a one-zone leptonic model whose parameters were derived with a
$\chi^2$-fit. We found that the broadband SED during different flux states can
be reproduced by the synchrotron, synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) and
External-Compton (EC) processes. The seed photons for EC process from BLR or IR
torus provide acceptable fits to the GeV spectrum in all the flux states;
however, the detection of HE photons together with the equipartition condition
suggest that the EC/IR process is a more likely scenario. Further, a detailed
comparison between the fit parameters shows that the flux enhancement from
quiescent-state to the flaring-state is mostly related to increase in the bulk
Lorentz factor of the emission region and change in the break energy of the
source spectrum.

game is a proper coloring of vertices of a graph $G$, and Alice's goal is that
as few colors as possible are used during the game, while Bob wants to maximize
the number of colors. The game consists of rounds, and in round $i$, where
$i=1,2,,\ldots$, the players are taking turns in selecting a previously
unselected vertex of $G$ and giving it color $i$ (hence, in each round the
selected vertices form an independent set). The game ends when all vertices of
$G$ are selected (and thus colored), and the total number of rounds during the
game when both players are playing optimally with respect to their goals, is
called the independence game chromatic number, $\chi_{ig}(G)$, of $G$. In fact,
four different versions of the independence game chromatic number are
considered, which depend on who starts a game and who starts next rounds. We
prove that the new invariants lie between the chromatic number of a graph and
the maximum degree plus $1$, and characterize the graphs in which each of the
four versions of the game invariant equals $2$. We compare the versions of the
independence game chromatic number among themselves and with the classical game
chromatic number. In addition, we prove that the independence game chromatic
number of a tree can be arbitrarily large.

    <title>Strong Exciton-Vibrational Coupling in Molecular Assemblies. Dynamics
  using the Polaron Transformation in HEOM Space</title>
    <summary>  In the context of Frenkel exciton dynamics in aggregated molecules the
polaron transformation technique facilitates a treatment where diagonal
elements attributed to electronic excited-state populations are decoupled from
fluctuations associated with vibrational degrees-of-freedom. In this article we
describe for the first time how the polaron transformation can be applied in
the context of the "Hierarchical Equations of Motion" (HEOM) technique for
treatment of open quantum systems with all vibrational components attributed to
an environment. By using a generating function approach to introduce a shift in
the excited state potential energy surface, we derive hierarchical equations
for polaron transformation in analogy to those for time propagation. We
demonstrate the applicability of the developed approach by calculating the
dynamics of underdamped and overdamped oscillators coupled to electronic
excitation of a monomer without and with previous polaron transformation and
study the dynamics of the expectation value of the respective vibrational
coordinates. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics of a dimer with a barrier
comparable to the thermal energy between the minima of the lower excitonic
potential energy surface. It turns out that the assumption of localization at
the monomer unit with energetically higher potential minimum, introduced via
polaron transformation, has a substantial influence on the transfer dynamics.
Here, it makes a clear difference whether the polaron transformation is
performed in the local or exciton basis. This reflects the fact that the
polaron transformation only accounts for equilibration of the vibrational, but
not of the excitonic dynamics. We sketch an approach to compensate this
shortcoming in view of obtaining an initial state for the calculation of
emission spectra of molecular aggregates.

    <title>Asymmetric CNN for image super-resolution</title>
    <summary>  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely applied for
low-level vision over the past five years. According to nature of different
applications, designing appropriate CNN architectures is developed. However,
customized architectures gather different features via treating all pixel
points as equal to improve the performance of given application, which ignores
the effects of local power pixel points and results in low training efficiency.
In this paper, we propose an asymmetric CNN (ACNet) comprising an asymmetric
block (AB), a mem?ory enhancement block (MEB) and a high-frequency feature
enhancement block (HFFEB) for image super-resolution. The AB utilizes
one-dimensional asymmetric convolutions to intensify the square convolution
kernels in horizontal and vertical directions for promoting the influences of
local salient features for SISR. The MEB fuses all hierarchical low-frequency
features from the AB via residual learning (RL) technique to resolve the
long-term dependency problem and transforms obtained low-frequency fea?tures
into high-frequency features. The HFFEB exploits low- and high-frequency
features to obtain more robust super-resolution features and address excessive
feature enhancement problem. Ad?ditionally, it also takes charge of
reconstructing a high-resolution (HR) image. Extensive experiments show that
our ACNet can effectively address single image super-resolution (SISR), blind
SISR and blind SISR of blind noise problems. The code of the ACNet is shown at
https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/ACNet.

    <title>Switching equivalence of Hermitian adjacency matrix of mixed graphs</title>
    <summary>  Let $0 \in \Gamma$ and $\Gamma \setminus \{0\}$ be an abelian group under
multiplication, where $\Gamma \setminus \{0\} \subseteq \{ z\in \mathbb{C}:
|z|=1 \}$. Define $\mathcal{H}_{n}(\Gamma)$ to be the set of all $n\times n$
Hermitian matrices with entries in $\Gamma$, whose diagonal entries are zero.
We introduce the notion of switching equivalence on $\mathcal{H}_{n}(\Gamma)$.
We find a characterization, in terms of fundamental cycles of graphs, of
switching equivalence of matrices in $\mathcal{H}_{n}(\Gamma)$. We give
sufficient conditions to characterize the cospectral matrices in
$\mathcal{H}_{n}(\Gamma)$. We find bounds on the number of switching
equivalence classes of all mixed graphs with the same underlying graph. We also
provide the size of all switching equivalence classes of mixed cycles, and give
a formula that calculates the size of a switching equivalence class of a mixed
planar graph. We also discuss the action of automorphism group of a graph on
switching equivalence classes.

    <title>SubSpectral Normalization for Neural Audio Data Processing</title>
    <summary>  Convolutional Neural Networks are widely used in various machine learning
domains. In image processing, the features can be obtained by applying 2D
convolution to all spatial dimensions of the input. However, in the audio case,
frequency domain input like Mel-Spectrogram has different and unique
characteristics in the frequency dimension. Thus, there is a need for a method
that allows the 2D convolution layer to handle the frequency dimension
differently. In this work, we introduce SubSpectral Normalization (SSN), which
splits the input frequency dimension into several groups (sub-bands) and
performs a different normalization for each group. SSN also includes an affine
transformation that can be applied to each group. Our method removes the
inter-frequency deflection while the network learns a frequency-aware
characteristic. In the experiments with audio data, we observed that SSN can
efficiently improve the network's performance.

    <title>Towards improving architectural diagram consistency using system
  descriptors</title>
    <summary>  Communication between practitioners is essential for the system's quality in
the DevOps context. To improve this communication, practitioners often use
informal diagrams to represent the components of a system. However, as systems
evolve, it is a challenge to synchronize diagrams with production environments
consistently. Hence, the inconsistency of architectural diagrams can affect
communication between practitioner and their understanding of systems. In this
paper, we propose the use of system descriptors to improve deployment diagram
consistency. We state two main hypotheses: (1) if an architectural diagram is
generated from a valid system descriptor, then the diagram is consistent; (2)
if a valid system descriptor is generated from an architectural diagram, then
the diagram is consistent. We report a case study to explore our hypotheses.
Furthermore, we constructed a system descriptor from the Netflix deployment
diagram, and we applied our tool to generate a new architectural diagram.
Finally, we compare the original and generated diagrams to evaluate our
proposal. Our case study shows all Docker compose description elements can be
graphically represented in the generated architectural diagram, and the
generated diagram does not present inconsistent aspects of the original
diagram. Thus, our preliminary results lead to further evaluation in controlled
and empirical experiments to test our hypotheses.

    <title>BERT4SO: Neural Sentence Ordering by Fine-tuning BERT</title>
    <summary>  Sentence ordering aims to arrange the sentences of a given text in the
correct order. Recent work frames it as a ranking problem and applies deep
neural networks to it. In this work, we propose a new method, named BERT4SO, by
fine-tuning BERT for sentence ordering. We concatenate all sentences and
compute their representations by using multiple special tokens and carefully
designed segment (interval) embeddings. The tokens across multiple sentences
can attend to each other which greatly enhances their interactions. We also
propose a margin-based listwise ranking loss based on ListMLE to facilitate the
optimization process. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

    <title>Task-Oriented Low-Dose CT Image Denoising</title>
    <summary>  The extensive use of medical CT has raised a public concern over the
radiation dose to the patient. Reducing the radiation dose leads to increased
CT image noise and artifacts, which can adversely affect not only the
radiologists judgement but also the performance of downstream medical image
analysis tasks. Various low-dose CT denoising methods, especially the recent
deep learning based approaches, have produced impressive results. However, the
existing denoising methods are all downstream-task-agnostic and neglect the
diverse needs of the downstream applications. In this paper, we introduce a
novel Task-Oriented Denoising Network (TOD-Net) with a task-oriented loss
leveraging knowledge from the downstream tasks. Comprehensive empirical
analysis shows that the task-oriented loss complements other task agnostic
losses by steering the denoiser to enhance the image quality in the task
related regions of interest. Such enhancement in turn brings general boosts on
the performance of various methods for the downstream task. The presented work
may shed light on the future development of context-aware image denoising
methods.

    <title>Nocturnal Seizure Detection Using Off-the-Shelf WiFi</title>
    <summary>  Detection of nocturnal seizures in epilepsy patients is essential, both for
the quick management of the seizure complications, and for the assessment of
the ongoing seizure treatment. Traditional seizure detection products (e.g.,
wearables), however, are either very costly, uncomfortable, or unreliable. In
this paper, we then propose to utilize everyday WiFi signals for robust, fast,
and non-invasive detection of nocturnal seizures. We first present a new and
rigorous mathematical characterization for the spectral content/bandwidth of
the WiFi signal, measured on a WiFi device placed near a sleeping patient,
during different kinds of sleep motions: seizures, normal movements (e.g.
posture adjustments), and breathing. Based on this mathematical modeling, we
propose a novel pipeline for processing the received WiFi signals to robustly
detect all nocturnal non-breathing movements, and then classify them into
normal body movements or seizures. In order to validate this, we carry out
extensive experiments in 7 different typical bedroom locations, where a set of
20 actors simulate the state of having seizures (total of 260 instances), as
well as normal sleep movements (total of 410 instances). Our proposed system
detects 93.85% of the seizures with a mean response time of only 5.69 seconds
since the onset of the seizure. Moreover, our proposed system achieves a
probability of false alarm of only 0.0097, when classifying normal sleep
movements. Overall, our new mathematical modeling and experimental results show
the great potential the ubiquitous WiFi signals have for detecting nocturnal
seizures, which can provide better support for epilepsy patients and their
caregivers.

    <title>Anonymous Tolling for Traffic Networks with Mixed Autonomy</title>
    <summary>  Road networks are used inefficiently when drivers selfishly choose their own
routes rather than being directed on routes to minimize the social cost, which
is the total travel delay experienced by all users. In the setting of mixed
autonomy, when there are multiple types of vehicles which affect congestion
differently, this inefficiency can increase greatly beyond the setting of only
a single vehicle type. In the single vehicle type setting, well-known optimal
tolls completely eliminate this inefficiency. However, the difficult qualities
of mixed autonomy makes it such that optimal tolls are unknown in this setting,
absent very restrictive assumptions. In this work we provide the first optimal
tolls for the mixed autonomous setting in general networks with multiple
source-destination pairs, where road latencies are affine functions of vehicle
flow. These optimal tolls are differentiated, meaning that the different
vehicle types must be given different toll values. Administering differentiated
tolls may be difficult -- to address this, we also provide anonymous tolls
which may reduce inefficiency in this setting. We quantify the limits of such
tolls and compare the performance of our tolls to these bounds.

    <title>Benchmarking Modern Named Entity Recognition Techniques for Free-text
  Health Record De-identification</title>
    <summary>  Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become the primary form of medical
data-keeping across the United States. Federal law restricts the sharing of any
EHR data that contains protected health information (PHI). De-identification,
the process of identifying and removing all PHI, is crucial for making EHR data
publicly available for scientific research. This project explores several deep
learning-based named entity recognition (NER) methods to determine which
method(s) perform better on the de-identification task. We trained and tested
our models on the i2b2 training dataset, and qualitatively assessed their
performance using EHR data collected from a local hospital. We found that 1)
BiLSTM-CRF represents the best-performing encoder/decoder combination, 2)
character-embeddings and CRFs tend to improve precision at the price of recall,
and 3) transformers alone under-perform as context encoders. Future work
focused on structuring medical text may improve the extraction of semantic and
syntactic information for the purposes of EHR de-identification.

    <title>Multi-view Fusion for Multi-level Robotic Scene Understanding</title>
    <summary>  We present a system for multi-level scene awareness for robotic manipulation.
Given a sequence of camera-in-hand RGB images, the system calculates three
types of information: 1) a point cloud representation of all the surfaces in
the scene, for the purpose of obstacle avoidance. 2) the rough pose of unknown
objects from categories corresponding to primitive shapes (e.g., cuboids and
cylinders), and 3) full 6-DoF pose of known objects. By developing and fusing
recent techniques in these domains, we provide a rich scene representation for
robot awareness. We demonstrate the importance of each of these modules, their
complementary nature, and the potential benefits of the system in the context
of robotic manipulation.

    <title>Improving Editorial Workflow and Metadata Quality at Springer Nature</title>
    <summary>  Identifying the research topics that best describe the scope of a scientific
publication is a crucial task for editors, in particular because the quality of
these annotations determine how effectively users are able to discover the
right content in online libraries. For this reason, Springer Nature, the
world's largest academic book publisher, has traditionally entrusted this task
to their most expert editors. These editors manually analyse all new books,
possibly including hundreds of chapters, and produce a list of the most
relevant topics. Hence, this process has traditionally been very expensive,
time-consuming, and confined to a few senior editors. For these reasons, back
in 2016 we developed Smart Topic Miner (STM), an ontology-driven application
that assists the Springer Nature editorial team in annotating the volumes of
all books covering conference proceedings in Computer Science. Since then STM
has been regularly used by editors in Germany, China, Brazil, India, and Japan,
for a total of about 800 volumes per year. Over the past three years the
initial prototype has iteratively evolved in response to feedback from the
users and evolving requirements. In this paper we present the most recent
version of the tool and describe the evolution of the system over the years,
the key lessons learnt, and the impact on the Springer Nature workflow. In
particular, our solution has drastically reduced the time needed to annotate
proceedings and significantly improved their discoverability, resulting in 9.3
million additional downloads. We also present a user study involving 9 editors,
which yielded excellent results in term of usability, and report an evaluation
of the new topic classifier used by STM, which outperforms previous versions in
recall and F-measure.

    <title>Iteration of Cox rings of klt singularities</title>
    <summary>  Given a klt singularity $(X,\Delta;x)$, we define the iteration of Cox rings
of $(X,\Delta;x)$. The first result of this article is that the iteration of
Cox rings ${\rm Cox}^{(k)}(X,\Delta;x)$ of a klt singularity stabilizes for $k$
large enough. The second result is a boundedness one, we prove that for a
$n$-dimensional klt singularity $(X,\Delta;x)$ the iteration of Cox rings
stabilizes for $k\geq c(n)$, where $c(n)$ only depends on $n$. Then, we use Cox
rings to establish the existence of a simply connected factorial canonical
cover (or scfc cover) of a klt singularity. We prove that the scfc cover
dominates any sequence of quasi-\'etale finite covers and reductive abelian
quasi-torsors of the singularity. We characterize when the iteration of Cox
rings is smooth and when the scfc cover is smooth. We also characterize when
the spectrum of the iteration coincides with the scfc cover. Finally, we give a
complete description of the regional fundamental group, the iteration of Cox
rings, and the scfc cover of klt singularities of complexity one. Analogous
versions of all our theorems are also proved for Fano type morphisms. To extend
the results to this setting, we show that the Jordan property holds for the
regional fundamental group of Fano type morphisms.

    <title>Analysis of Truncated Orthogonal Iteration for Sparse Eigenvector
  Problems</title>
    <summary>  A wide range of problems in computational science and engineering require
estimation of sparse eigenvectors for high dimensional systems. Here, we
propose two variants of the Truncated Orthogonal Iteration to compute multiple
leading eigenvectors with sparsity constraints simultaneously. We establish
numerical convergence results for the proposed algorithms using a perturbation
framework, and extend our analysis to other existing alternatives for sparse
eigenvector estimation. We then apply our algorithms to solve the sparse
principle component analysis problem for a wide range of test datasets, from
simple simulations to real-world datasets including MNIST, sea surface
temperature and 20 newsgroups. In all these cases, we show that the new methods
get state of the art results quickly and with minimal parameter tuning.

    <title>Conditions and Assumptions for Constraint-based Causal Structure
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  The paper formalizes constraint-based structure learning of the "true" causal
graph from observed data when unobserved variables are also existent. We define
a "generic" structure learning algorithm, which provides conditions that, under
the faithfulness assumption, the output of all known exact algorithms in the
literature must satisfy, and which outputs graphs that are Markov equivalent to
the causal graph. More importantly, we provide clear assumptions, weaker than
faithfulness, under which the same generic algorithm outputs Markov equivalent
graphs to the causal graph. We provide the theory for the general class of
models under the assumption that the distribution is Markovian to the true
causal graph, and we specialize the definitions and results for structural
causal models.

    <title>Non-Hermitian gauge field theories and BPS limits</title>
    <summary>  We present an overview of some key results obtained in a recent series
devoted to non-Hermitian quantum field theories for which we systematically
modify the underlying symmetries. Particular attention is placed on the
interplay between the continuous symmetry group that we alter from global to
local, from Abelian to non-Abelian, from rank one to generic rank N, and the
discrete anti-linear modified CPT-symmetries. The presence of the latter
guarantees the reality of the mass spectrum in a certain parameter regime. We
investigate the extension of Goldstone's theorem and the Higgs mechanism, which
we demonstrate to work in the conventional fashion in the CPT symmetric regime,
but which needs to be modified technically at the standard exceptional points
of the mass spectrum and entirely fails at what we refer to as zero exceptional
points as well as in the broken CPT-symmetric regime. In the full non-Hermitian
non-Abelian gauge theory we identify the t'Hooft-Polyakov monopoles by means of
a fourfold Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit. We investigate this
limit further for other types of non-Hermitian field theories in 1+1 dimensions
that possess complex super-exponential and inverse hyperbolic kink/anti-kink
solutions and for 3+1 dimensional Skyrme models for which we find new types of
complex solutions, that all have real energies due to the presence of different
types of CPT-symmetries.

    <title>Hierarchical Hyperedge Embedding-based Representation Learning for Group
  Recommendation</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we study group recommendation in a particular scenario, namely
Occasional Group Recommendation (OGR). Most existing works have addressed OGR
by aggregating group members' personal preferences to learn the group
representation. However, the representation learning for a group is most
complex beyond the fusion of group member representation, as the personal
preferences and group preferences may be in different spaces. In addition, the
learned user representation is not accurate due to the sparsity of users'
interaction data. Moreover, the group similarity in terms of common group
members has been overlooked, which however has the great potential to improve
the group representation learning. In this work, we focus on addressing the
above challenges in group representation learning task, and devise a
hierarchical hyperedge embedding-based group recommender, namely HyperGroup.
Specifically, we propose to leverage the user-user interactions to alleviate
the sparsity issue of user-item interactions, and design a GNN-based
representation learning network to enhance the learning of individuals'
preferences from their friends' preferences, which provides a solid foundation
for learning groups' preferences. To exploit the group similarity to learn a
more accurate group representation from highly limited group-item interactions,
we connect all groups as a network of overlapping sets, and treat the task of
group preference learning as embedding hyperedges in a hypergraph, where an
inductive hyperedge embedding method is proposed. To further enhance the
group-level preference modeling, we develop a joint training strategy to learn
both user-item and group-item interactions in the same process. We conduct
extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and the experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed HyperGroup in comparison to the
state-of-the-art baselines.

    <title>The combinatorial game nofil played on Steiner Triple Systems</title>
    <summary>  We introduce an impartial combinatorial game on Steiner triple systems called
Nofil. Players move alternately, choosing points of the triple system. If a
player is forced to fill a block on their turn, they lose. We explore the play
of Nofil on all Steiner triple systems up to order 15 and a sampling for orders
19, 21, and 25. We determine the optimal strategies by computing the nim-values
for each game and its subgames. The game Nofil can be thought of in terms of
play on a corresponding hypergraph. As game play progresses, the hypergraph
shrinks and will eventually be equivalent to playing the game Node Kayles on an
isomorphic graph. Node Kayles is well studied and understood. Motivated by
this, we study which Node Kayles positions can be reached, i.e. embedded into a
Steiner triple system. We prove necessary conditions and sufficient conditions
for the existence of such graph embeddings and conclude that the complexity of
determining the outcome of the game Nofil on Steiner triple systems is
PSPACE-complete.

    <title>Energetics and 3-D Structure of Elementary Events in Solar Coronal
  Heating</title>
    <summary>  Parker (1972) first proposed that coronal heating was the necessary outcome
of an energy flux caused by the tangling of coronal magnetic field lines by
photospheric flows. In this paper we discuss how this model has been modified
by subsequent numerical simulations outlining in particular the substantial
differences between the "nanoflares" introduced by Parker and "elementary
events", defined here as small-scale spatially and temporally isolated heating
events resulting from the continuous formation and dissipation of field-aligned
current sheets within a coronal loop. We present numerical simulations of the
compressible 3-D MHD equations using the HYPERION code. We use two clustering
algorithms to investigate the properties of the simulated elementary events: an
IDL implementation of a Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with
Noise (DBSCAN) technique; and our own Physical Distance Clustering (PDC)
algorithm. We identify and track elementary heating events in time, both in
temperature and in Joule heating space. For every event we characterize
properties such as: density, temperature, volume, aspect ratio, length,
thickness, duration and energy. The energies of the events are in the range
$10^{18}-10^{21}$ ergs, with durations shorter than 100 seconds. A few events
last up to 200 seconds and release energies up to $10^{23}$ ergs. While high
temperature are typically located at the flux tube apex, the currents extend
all the way to the footpoints. Hence a single elementary event cannot at
present be detected. The observed emission is due to the superposition of many
elementary events distributed randomly in space and time within the loop.

    <title>The Ly$α$ forest flux correlation function: a perturbation theory
  perspective</title>
    <summary>  The Ly$\alpha$ forest provides one of the best means of mapping large-scale
structure at high redshift, including our tightest constraint on the
distance-redshift relation before cosmic noon. We describe how the large-scale
correlations in the Ly$\alpha$ forest can be understood as an expansion in
cumulants of the optical depth field, which itself can be related to the
density field by a bias expansion. This provides a direct connection between
the observable and the statistics of the matter fluctuations which can be
computed in a systematic manner. We discuss the way in which complex,
small-scale physics enters the predictions, the origin of the much-discussed
velocity bias and the `renormalization' of the large-scale bias coefficients.
Our calculations are within the context of perturbation theory, but we also
make contact with earlier work using the peak-background split. Using the
structure of the equations of motion we demonstrate, to all orders in
perturbation theory, that the large-scale flux power spectrum becomes the
linear spectrum times the square of a quadratic in the cosine of the angle to
the line of sight. Unlike the case of galaxies, both the isotropic and
anisotropic pieces receive contributions from small-scale physics.

    <title>3D Reasoning for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Pediatric WbMRI</title>
    <summary>  Modern deep unsupervised learning methods have shown great promise for
detecting diseases across a variety of medical imaging modalities. While
previous generative modeling approaches successfully perform anomaly detection
by learning the distribution of healthy 2D image slices, they process such
slices independently and ignore the fact that they are correlated, all being
sampled from a 3D volume. We show that incorporating the 3D context and
processing whole-body MRI volumes is beneficial to distinguishing anomalies
from their benign counterparts. In our work, we introduce a multi-channel
sliding window generative model to perform lesion detection in whole-body MRI
(wbMRI). Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly
outperforms processing individual images in isolation and our ablations clearly
show the importance of 3D reasoning. Moreover, our work also shows that it is
beneficial to include additional patient-specific features to further improve
anomaly detection in pediatric scans.

    <title>A compendium of covariances and correlation coefficients of coalescent
  tree properties</title>
    <summary>  Gene genealogies are frequently studied by measuring properties such as their
height ($H$), length ($L$), sum of external branches ($E$), sum of internal
branches ($I$), and mean of their two basal branches ($B$), and the coalescence
times that contribute to the other genealogical features ($T$). These tree
properties and their relationships can provide insight into the effects of
population-genetic processes on genealogies and genetic sequences. Here, under
the coalescent model, we study the 15 correlations among pairs of features of
genealogical trees: $H_n$, $L_n$, $E_n$, $I_n$, $B_n$, and $T_k$ for a sample
of size $n$, with $2 \leq k \leq n$. We report high correlations among $H_n$,
$L_n$, $I_n,$ and $B_n$, with all pairwise correlations of these quantities
having values greater than or equal to $\sqrt{6} [6 \zeta(3) + 6 - \pi^2] / (
\pi \sqrt{18 + 9\pi^2 - \pi^4}) \approx 0.84930$ in the limit as $n \rightarrow
\infty$. Although $E_n$ has an expectation of 2 for all $n$ and $H_n$ has
expectation 2 in the limit as $n \rightarrow \infty$, their limiting
correlation is 0. The results contribute toward understanding features of the
shapes of coalescent trees.

    <title>A Matrix Finsler's Lemma with Applications to Data-Driven Control</title>
    <summary>  In a recent paper it was shown how a matrix S-lemma can be applied to
construct controllers from noisy data. The current paper complements these
results by proving a matrix version of the classical Finsler's lemma. This
matrix Finsler's lemma provides a tractable condition under which all matrix
solutions to a quadratic equality also satisfy a quadratic inequality. We will
apply this result to bridge known data-driven control design techniques for
both exact and noisy data, thereby revealing a more general theory. The result
is also applied to data-driven control of Lur'e systems.

    <title>Exotic diboson $Z'$ decays in the U$μν$SSM</title>
    <summary>  Searches for new leptophobic resonances at high energy colliders usually
target their decay modes into pairs of light quarks, top quarks, or standard
model bosons. Additional decay modes may also be present, producing signatures
to which current searches are not sensitive. We investigate the performance of
generic searches that look for resonances decaying into two large-radius jets.
As benchmark for our analysis we use a supersymmetric $\text{U}(1)'$ extension
of the Standard Model, the so-called U$\mu\nu$SSM, where all the SM decay modes
of the $Z'$ boson take place, plus additional (cascade) decays into new
scalars. The generic searches use a generic multi-pronged jet tagger and take
advantage of the presence of $b$ quarks in the large-radius jets, and are
sensitive to all these $Z'$ decay modes (except into light quarks) at once. For
couplings that are well below current experimental constraints, these generic
searches are sensitive at the $3\sigma-4\sigma$ level with Run 2 LHC data.

    <title>Cosmological constraints of interacting phantom dark energy models</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we consider three phantom dark energy models, in the context
of interaction between the dark components namely cold dark matter (CDM) and
dark energy (DE). The first model, known as $w_{\textrm{d}}$CDM can induce a
big rip singularity (BR) while the two remaining induce future abrupt events
known as the Little Rip (LR) and Little Sibling of the Big Rip (LSBR). These
phantom DE models can be distinguished by their equation of state. We invoke a
new phenomenon such as the interaction between CDM and DE given that it could
solve or alleviate some of the problems encountered in standard cosmology. We
aim to find out the effect of such an interaction on the cosmological
parameters of the studied models, as well as, the persistence or the
disappearance of the singularity and the abrupt events induced by the models
under study. We choose an interaction term proportional to DE density, i.e.
$Q=\lambda H \rho_{\textrm{d}}$, since the case where $Q\propto
\rho_{\textrm{m}}$ could lead to a large scale instability at early time. We
also do not claim at all that $Q=\lambda H \rho_{\textrm{d}}$ is the ideal
choice since it suffers from a negative CDM density in the future. By the use
of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, and by assuming a flat FLRW
Universe, we constrain the cosmological parameters of each of the three phantom
DE models studied. Furthermore, by the aid of the corrected Akaike Information
Criterion ($\text{AIC}_{c}$) tool, we compare our phantom DE models. Finally, a
perturbative analysis of phantom DE models under consideration is performed
based on the best fit background parameters.

    <title>Evolution of Neutrino Mass-Mixing Parameters in Matter with Non-Standard
  Interactions</title>
    <summary>  We explore the role of matter effect in the evolution of neutrino oscillation
parameters in the presence of lepton-flavor-conserving and
lepton-flavor-violating neutral-current non-standard interactions (NSI) of the
neutrino. We derive simple approximate analytical expressions showing the
evolution/running of mass-mixing parameters in matter with energy in the
presence of standard interactions (SI) and SI+NSI (considering both positive
and negative values of real NSI parameters). We observe that only the NSI
parameters in the (2,3) block, namely $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$ and $(\gamma -
\beta) \equiv (\varepsilon_{\tau\tau} - \varepsilon_{\mu\mu})$ affect the
running of $\theta_{23}$. Though all the NSI parameters influence the evolution
of $\theta_{13}$, $\varepsilon_{e\mu}$ and $\varepsilon_{e\tau}$ show a
stronger impact at the energies relevant for DUNE. $\theta_{12}$ quickly
approaches to $\sim$ $90^{\circ}$ with increasing energy in both SI and SI+NSI
cases. The change in $\Delta m^2_{21,m}$ is quite significant as compared to
$\Delta m^2_{31,m}$ both in SI and SI+NSI frameworks. Flipping the signs of the
NSI parameters alters the way in which mass-mixing parameters run with energy.
We demonstrate the utility of our approach in addressing several important
features related to neutrino oscillation such as: a) unraveling interesting
degeneracies between $\theta_{23}$ and NSI parameters, b) estimating the
resonance energy in presence of NSI when $\theta_{13}$ in matter becomes
maximal, c) figuring out the required baselines and energies to have maximal
matter effect in $\nu_{\mu}$ $\rightarrow$ $\nu_{e}$ transition in the presence
of different NSI parameters, and d) studying the impact of NSI parameters
$\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$ and $(\gamma - \beta)$ on the $\nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{\mu}$
survival probability.

    <title>Operator front broadening in chaotic and integrable quantum chains</title>
    <summary>  Operator spreading under unitary time evolution has attracted a lot of
attention recently, as a way to probe many-body quantum chaos. While quantities
such as out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC) do distinguish interacting from
non-interacting systems, it has remained unclear to what extent they can truly
diagnose chaotic {\it vs} integrable dynamics in many-body quantum systems.
Here, we analyze operator spreading in generic 1D many-body quantum systems
using a combination of matrix product operator (MPO) and analytical techniques,
focusing on the operator {\em right-weight}. First, we show that while small
bond dimension MPOs allow one to capture the exponentially-decaying tail of the
operator front, in agreement with earlier results, they lead to significant
quantitative and qualitative errors for the actual front -- defined by the
maximum of the right-weight. We find that while the operator front broadens
diffusively in both integrable and chaotic interacting spin chains, the precise
shape and scaling of the height of the front in integrable systems is anomalous
for all accessible times. We interpret these results using a quasiparticle
picture. This provides a sharp, though rather subtle signature of many-body
quantum chaos in the operator front.

    <title>A master exceptional field theory</title>
    <summary>  We construct a pseudo-Lagrangian that is invariant under rigid $E_{11}$ and
transforms as a density under $E_{11}$ generalised diffeomorphisms. The
gauge-invariance requires the use of a section condition studied in previous
work on $E_{11}$ exceptional field theory and the inclusion of constrained
fields that transform in an indecomposable $E_{11}$-representation together
with the $E_{11}$ coset fields. We show that, in combination with
gauge-invariant and $E_{11}$-invariant duality equations, this
pseudo-Lagrangian reduces to the bosonic sector of non-linear
eleven-dimensional supergravity for one choice of solution to the section
condition. For another choice, we reobtain the $E_8$ exceptional field theory
and conjecture that our pseudo-Lagrangian and duality equations produce all
exceptional field theories with maximal supersymmetry in any dimension. We also
describe how the theory entails non-linear equations for higher dual fields,
including the dual graviton in eleven dimensions. Furthermore, we speculate on
the relation to the $E_{10}$ sigma model.

    <title>Statistical Fitting of Evolution Models to Rotation Rates of Sun-Like
  Stars</title>
    <summary>  We apply for the first time a two-dimensional fitting statistic, $\tau^2$, to
rotational evolution models (REMs) of stars (0.1 to 1.3 $M_{\odot}$) on the
period-mass plane. The $\tau^2$ statistic simultaneously considers all cluster
rotation data to return a goodness of fit, allowing for data-driven improvement
of REMs. We construct data sets for Upper Sco, the Pleiades and Praesepe, to
which we tune our REMs. We use consistently determined stellar masses
(calculated by matching $K_\textrm{s}$ magnitudes to isochrones) and literature
rotation periods. As a first demonstration of the $\tau^2$ statistic, we find
the best-fitting gyrochronology age for Praesepe, which is in good agreement
with the literature. We then systematically vary three parameters which
determine the dependence of our stellar wind torque law on Rossby number in the
saturated and unsaturated regimes, and the location of the transition between
the two. By minimising $\tau^2$, we find best-fit values for each parameter.
These values vary slightly between clusters, mass determinations and initial
conditions, highlighting the precision of $\tau^2$ and its potential for
constraining REMs, gyrochronology, and understanding of stellar physics. Our
resulting REMs, which implement the best-possible fitting form of a broken
power-law torque, are statistically improved on previous REMs using similar
formulations, but still do not simultaneously describe the observed rotation
distributions of the lowest masses, which have both slow and fast rotators by
the Praesepe age, and the shape of the converged sequence for higher masses.
Further complexity in the REMs is thus required to accurately describe the
data.

    <title>Supersymmetric spectroscopy on AdS$_4\times S^7$ and AdS$_4\times S^6$</title>
    <summary>  New techniques based on Exceptional Field Theory have recently allowed for
the calculation of the Kaluza-Klein spectra of certain AdS$_4$ solutions of
$D=11$ and massive IIA supergravity. These are the solutions that consistently
uplift on $S^7$ and $S^6$ from vacua of maximal four-dimensional supergravity
with SO(8) and ISO(7) gaugings. In this paper, we provide the complete
Kaluza-Klein spectrum of five such AdS$_4$ solutions, all of them ${\cal N}=1$.
These solutions preserve SO(3) and $\textrm{U}(1) \times \textrm{U}(1)$
internal symmetry in $D=11$, and U(1) (two of them) and no continuous symmetry
in type IIA. Together with previously discussed cases, our results exhaust the
Kaluza-Klein spectra of known supersymmetric AdS$_4$ solutions in $D=11$ and
type IIA in the relevant class.

    <title>SMBH Seeds from Dissipative Dark Matter</title>
    <summary>  The existence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses greater than
$\sim 10^{9}M_{\odot}$ at high redshift ($z\gtrsim 7$) is difficult to be
accommodated in standard astrophysical scenarios. We study the possibility that
(nearly) totally dissipative self-interacting dark matter (tdSIDM)--in rare,
high density dark matter fluctuations in the early Universe--produces SMBH
seeds through catastrophic collapse. We use a semi-analytic model, tested and
calibrated by a series of N-body simulations of isolated dark matter halos, to
compute the collapse criteria and timescale of tdSIDM halos, where dark matter
loses nearly all of its kinetic energy in a single collision in the
center-of-momentum frame. Applying this model to halo merger trees, we
empirically assign SMBH seeds to halos and trace the formation and evolution
history of SMBHs. We make predictions for the quasar luminosity function, the
$M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma_{\rm v}^{\ast}$ relation, and cosmic SMBH mass density at
high redshift and compare them to observations. We find that a dissipative dark
matter interaction cross-section of $\sigma/m \sim 0.05~\rm cm^2/g$ is
sufficient to produce the SMBHs observed in the early Universe while remaining
consistent with ordinary SMBHs in the late Universe.

    <title>Improved $(g-2)_μ$ Measurements and Wino/Higgsino Dark Matter</title>
    <summary>  The electroweak (EW) sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM) can account for a variety of experimental data. In particular, it can
explain the persistent 3-4 sigma discrepancy between the experimental result
for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and its Standard Model (SM)
prediction. The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which we take as the
lightest neutralino, can furthermore account for the observed Dark Matter (DM)
content of the universe via coannihilation with the next-to-LSP (NLSP), while
being in agreement with negative results from Direct Detection (DD)
experiments. Concerning the unsuccessful searches for EW superparticles at the
LHC, owing to relatively small production cross-sections, a comparably light EW
sector of the MSSM is in full agreement with the experimental data. The DM
relic density can fully be explained by a mixed bino/wino LSP. Here we take the
relic density as an upper bound, which opens up the possibility of wino and
higgsino DM. We first analyze which mass ranges of neutralinos, charginos and
scalar leptons are in agreement with all experimental data, including relevant
LHC searches. We find roughly an upper limit of ~ 600 GeV for the LSP and NLSP
masses. In a second step we assume that the new result of the Run 1 of the
'MUON G-2' collaboration at Fermilab yields a precision comparable to the
existing experimental result with the same central value. We analyze the
potential impact of the combination of the Run 1 data with the existing muon
g-2 data on the allowed MSSM parameter space. We find that in this case the
upper limits on the LSP and NLSP masses are substantially reduced by roughly
100 GeV. We interpret these upper bounds in view of future HL-LHC EW searches
as well as future high-energy electron-positron colliders, such as the ILC or
CLIC.

    <title>Exactly solvable models for U(1) symmetry-enriched topological phases</title>
    <summary>  We propose a general construction of commuting projector lattice models for
2D and 3D topological phases enriched by U(1) symmetry, with finite-dimensional
Hilbert space per site. The construction starts from a commuting projector
model of the topological phase and decorates U(1) charges to the state space in
a consistent manner. We show that all 2D U(1) symmetry-enriched topological
phases which allow gapped boundary without breaking symmetry, can be realized
through our construction. We also construct a large class of 3D topological
phases with U(1) symmetry fractionalized on particles or loop excitations.

    <title>EFT of 6D SUSY RG Flows</title>
    <summary>  Motivated by its potential use in constraining the structure of 6D
renormalization group flows, we determine the low energy dilaton-axion
effective field theory of conformal and global symmetry breaking in 6D
conformal field theories (CFTs). While our analysis is largely independent of
supersymmetry, we also investigate the case of 6D superconformal field theories
(SCFTs), where we use the effective action to present a streamlined proof of
the 6D a-theorem for tensor branch flows, as well as to constrain properties of
Higgs branch and mixed branch flows. An analysis of Higgs branch flows in some
examples leads us to conjecture that in 6D SCFTs, an interacting dilaton
effective theory may be possible even when certain 4-dilaton 4-derivative
interaction terms vanish, because of large momentum modifications to 4-point
dilaton scattering amplitudes. This possibility is due to the fact that in all
known $D &gt; 4$ CFTs, the approach to a conformal fixed point involves effective
strings which are becoming tensionless.

    <title>Covariant Function Algebras of Invariant Characters of Normal Subgroups</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents abstract harmonic analysis foundations for structure of
covariant function algebras of invariant characters of normal subgroups.
Suppose that $G$ is a locally compact group and $N$ is a closed normal subgroup
of $G$. Let $\xi:N\to\mathbb{T}$ be a continuous $G$-invariant character, $1\le
p&lt;\infty$, and $L_\xi^p(G,N)$ be the $L^p$-space of all covariant functions of
$\xi$ on $G$. We study structure of covariant convolution in $L^p_\xi(G,N)$. It
is proved that $L^1_\xi(G,N)$ is a Banach $*$-algebra and $L^p_\xi(G,N)$ is a
Banach $L^1_\xi(G,N)$-module. We then investigate the theory of covariant
convolutions for the case of characters of canonical normal subgroups in
semi-direct product groups. The paper is concluded by realization of the theory
in the case of different examples.

    <title>Characterizing total negativity</title>
    <summary>  A matrix is called totally negative (totally non-positive) of order $k$, if
all its minors of size at most $k$ are negative (non-positive). The objective
of this article is to provide several novel characterizations of total
negativity via the (a) sign non-reversal property, (b) variation diminishing
property, and (c) Linear Complementarity Problem. More strongly, each of these
three characterizations uses a single test vector. As an application of the
sign non-reversal property, we study the interval hull of two rectangular
matrices. In particular, we identify two matrices in the interval hull that
test total negativity of order $k$, simultaneously for the entire interval
hull. We also prove analogous characterizations for totally non-positive
matrices.
  These novel characterizations may be considered similar in spirit to
fundamental results characterizing totally positive matrices by
Brown-Johnstone-MacGibbon [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 1981] (see also
Gantmacher-Krein, 1950), Choudhury-Kannan-Khare [Bull. London Math. Soc.}, in
press] and Choudhury [2021 preprint].

    <title>The singular set in the Stefan problem</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we analyze the singular set in the Stefan problem and prove the
following results:
  - The singular set has parabolic Hausdorff dimension at most $n-1$.
  - The solution admits a $C^\infty$-expansion at all singular points, up to a
set of parabolic Hausdorff dimension at most $n-2$.
  - In $\mathbb R^3$, the free boundary is smooth for almost every time $t$,
and the set of singular times $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb R$ has Hausdorff
dimension at most $1/2$.
  These results provide us with a refined understanding of the Stefan problem's
singularities and answer some long-standing open questions in the field.

    <title>Rough pseudodifferential operators on Hardy spaces for Fourier integral
  operators II</title>
    <summary>  We obtain improved bounds for pseudodifferential operators with rough symbols
on Hardy spaces for Fourier integral operators. The symbols $a(x,\eta)$ are
elements of $C^{r}_{*}S^{m}_{1,\delta}$ classes that have limited regularity in
the $x$ variable. We show that the associated pseudodifferential operator
$a(x,D)$ maps between Sobolev spaces $\mathcal{H}^{p,s}_{FIO}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$
and $\mathcal{H}^{p,t}_{FIO}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ over the Hardy space for Fourier
integral operators $\mathcal{H}^{p}_{FIO}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$. Our main result is
that for all $r&gt;0$, $m=0$ and $\delta=1/2$, there exists an interval of $p$
around $2$ such that $a(x,D)$ acts boundedly on
$\mathcal{H}^{p}_{FIO}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$.

    <title>Characterizing the X-ray Emission of Intermediate-Mass Pre-Main-Sequence
  Stars</title>
    <summary>  We use X-ray and infrared observations to study the properties of three
classes of young stars in the Carina Nebula: intermediate-mass (2--8M$_\odot$)
pre-main sequence stars (IMPS; i.e. intermediate-mass T Tauri stars), late-B
and A stars on the zero-age main sequence (AB), and lower-mass T Tauri stars
(TTS). We divide our sources among these three sub-classifications and further
identify disk-bearing young stellar objects versus diskless sources with no
detectable infrared (IR) excess emission using IR (1--8 $\mu$m) spectral energy
distribution modeling. We then perform X-ray spectral fitting to determine the
hydrogen absorbing column density ($N_{\rm H}$), absorption-corrected X-ray
luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$), and coronal plasma temperature ($kT$) for each
source. We find that the X-ray spectra of both IMPS and TTS are characterized
by similar $kT$ and $N_{\rm H}$, and on average $L_{\rm X}$/$L_{\rm bol}
\sim4\times10^{-4}$. IMPS are systematically more luminous in X-rays (by
$\sim$0.3 dex) than all other sub-classifications, with median $L_{\rm X} =
2.5\times10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$, while AB stars of similar masses have X-ray
emission consistent with TTS companions. These lines of evidence converge on a
magneto-coronal flaring source for IMPS X-ray emission, a scaled-up version of
the TTS emission mechanism. IMPS therefore provide powerful probes of
isochronal ages for the first $\sim$10 Myr in the evolution of a massive
stellar population, because their intrinsic, coronal X-ray emission decays
rapidly after they commence evolving along radiative tracks. We suggest that
the most luminous (in both X-rays and IR) IMPS could be used to place empirical
constraints on the location of the intermediate-mass stellar birth line.
