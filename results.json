Cloud computing is based on backward\ncomputing schemes like cluster computing, distributed computing, grid computing\nand utility computing. The basic concept of cloud computing is virtualization.\nIt provides virtual hardware and software resources to various requesting\nprograms. This paper gives a detailed description about cluster computing, grid\ncomputing and cloud computing and gives an insight of some implementations of\nthe same. We try to list the inspirations for the advent of all these\ntechnologies. We also account for some present scenario faults of grid\ncomputing and also discuss new cloud computing projects which are being managed\nby the Government of India for learning.

    "title": "Analysis on Computation-Intensive Status Update in Mobile Edge Computing",
    "summary": "In status update scenarios, the freshness of information is measured in terms\nof age-of-information (AoI), which essentially reflects the timeliness for\nreal-time applications to transmit status update messages to a remote\ncontroller. For some applications, computational expensive and time consuming\ndata processing is inevitable for status information of messages to be\ndisplayed. Mobile edge servers are equipped with adequate computation resources\nand they are placed close to users. Thus, mobile edge computing (MEC) can be a\npromising technology to reduce AoI for computation-intensive messages. In this\npaper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive messages with MEC, and\nconsider three computing schemes: local computing, remote computing at the MEC\nserver, and partial computing, i.e., some part of computing tasks are performed\nlocally, and the rest is executed at the MEC server. Zero-wait policy is\nadopted in all three schemes. Specifically, in local computing, a new message\nis generated immediately after the previous one is revealed by computing. While\nin remote computing and partial computing, a new message is generated once the\nprevious one is received by the remote MEC server. With infinite queue size and\nexponentially distributed transmission time, closed-form average AoI for\nexponentially distributed computing time is derived for the three computing\nschemes. For deterministic computing time, the average AoI is analyzed\nnumerically. Simulation results show that by carefully partitioning the\ncomputing tasks, the average AoI in partial computing is the smallest compared\nto local computing and remote computing. The results also indicate numerically\nthe conditions on which remote computing attains smaller average AoI compared\nwith local computing.",

    "summary": "We propose a definition of computable manifold by introducing computability\nas a structure that we impose to a given topological manifold, just in the same\nway as differentiability or piecewise linearity are defined for smooth and PL\nmanifolds respectively. Using the framework of computable topology and Type-2\ntheory of effectivity, we develop computable versions of all the basic concepts\nneeded to define manifolds, like computable atlases and (computably) compatible\ncomputable atlases. We prove that given a computable atlas $\\Phi$ defined on a\nset $M$, we can construct a computable topological space $(M, \\tau_\\Phi,\n\\beta_\\Phi, \\nu_\\Phi)$, where $\\tau_\\Phi$ is the topology on $M$ induced by\n$\\Phi$ and that the equivalence class of this computable space characterizes\nthe computable structure determined by $\\Phi$. The concept of computable\nsubmanifold is also investigated. We show that any compact computable manifold\nwhich satisfies a computable version of the $T_2$-separation axiom, can be\nembedded as a computable submanifold of some euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$,\nwith a computable embedding, where $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$ is equipped with its usual\ntopology and some canonical computable encoding of all open rational balls.",

    "summary": "The Church-Turing thesis states that any sufficiently powerful computational\nmodel which captures the notion of algorithm is computationally equivalent to\nthe Turing machine. This equivalence usually holds both at a computability\nlevel and at a computational complexity level modulo polynomial reductions.\nHowever, the situation is less clear in what concerns models of computation\nusing real numbers, and no analog of the Church-Turing thesis exists for this\ncase. Recently it was shown that some models of computation with real numbers\nwere equivalent from a computability perspective. In particular it was shown\nthat Shannon's General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC) is equivalent to\nComputable Analysis. However, little is known about what happens at a\ncomputational complexity level. In this paper we shed some light on the\nconnections between this two models, from a computational complexity level, by\nshowing that, modulo polynomial reductions, computations of Turing machines can\nbe simulated by GPACs, without the need of using more (space) resources than\nthose used in the original Turing computation, as long as we are talking about\nbounded computations. In other words, computations done by the GPAC are as\nspace-efficient as computations done in the context of Computable Analysis.",

    "title": "Typologies of Computation and Computational Models",
    "summary": "We need much better understanding of information processing and computation\nas its primary form. Future progress of new computational devices capable of\ndealing with problems of big data, internet of things, semantic web, cognitive\nrobotics and neuroinformatics depends on the adequate models of computation. In\nthis article we first present the current state of the art through\nsystematization of existing models and mechanisms, and outline basic structural\nframework of computation. We argue that defining computation as information\nprocessing, and given that there is no information without (physical)\nrepresentation, the dynamics of information on the fundamental level is\nphysical/ intrinsic/ natural computation. As a special case, intrinsic\ncomputation is used for designed computation in computing machinery. Intrinsic\nnatural computation occurs on variety of levels of physical processes,\ncontaining the levels of computation of living organisms (including highly\nintelligent animals) as well as designed computational devices. The present\narticle offers a typology of current models of computation and indicates future\npaths for the advancement of the field; both by the development of new\ncomputational models and by learning from nature how to better compute using\ndifferent mechanisms of intrinsic computation.",
